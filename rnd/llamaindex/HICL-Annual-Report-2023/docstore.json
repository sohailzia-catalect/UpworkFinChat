Inflation reached its highest level in over 30 years across HICL \u2019s core geographies, resulting in increased interest rates and significant financial market volatility. Cash flows from the Company\u2019s diversified portfolio benefit from high inflation correlation and robust capital structures with limited sensitivity to higher financing costs. Proactive management of the Company\u2019s debt facilities and accretive share issuance in the year ensured that HICL maintained a\u00a0solid balance sheet position throughout.\nThe Board and HICL \u2019s Investment Manager, \nInfraRed Capital Partners (\u201cInfraRed\u201d), remain focused on the active management of portfolio composition, with a clear strategy to markedly increase asset life and future earnings generation within the portfolio, such\u00a0that HICL remains well positioned for the long term as its PPP concessions mature and redeem capital. Targeted acquisitions and disposals in the year have contributed significantly to this strategy; effectively recycling capital, improving diversification and introducing highly attractive asset characteristics into the portfolio.Financial performance\nFinancial performance in the year to 31 March 2023 has been resilient, with Net Asset Value (\u201cNAV\u201d) growth of 1.8p per share to 164.9p. The return from the portfolio was 10.2% (March 2022: 9.6%), outperforming the Company\u2019s expected return of 6.6% for the period (the Company\u2019s weighted average discount rate as at 31 March 2022). \nNAV growth in the year was primarily driven \nby the impact of higher actual and forecast inflation on the Company\u2019s cash flows. HICL \u2019s strong inflation correlation of 0.8x serves to protect investors\u2019 capital in higher inflationary environments such as those experienced over the past 12 months. Strong inflation correlation is a deliberate part of portfolio composition and its positive effect more than offset the associated impact of higher long-term government bond yields in the year, which saw the portfolio\u2019s weighted average discount rate increase from 6.6% to 7.2%.\nA more detailed explanation of the portfolio\u2019s \nvaluation and discount rate movements over the past year is given in the Valuation of the Portfolio section, starting on page 46.\nBusiness model in action\nHICL delivers value by investing in and actively managing high-quality core infrastructure assets in attractive sectors and geographies (for more information see HICL \u2019s core infrastructure framework on page 14). Societal demand for new infrastructure remains strong, due to ageing assets and demographic shifts, and is being driven by the powerful megatrends of digitalisation and decarbonisation. These transformative forces present significant opportunities for HICL to invest in attractive sectors, where investments offer a core infrastructure risk profile, stable income and the prospect of long-term capital growth. Further discussion on the core infrastructure market can be found on page 10.Our performance \ndemonstrates the defensive nature of core infrastructure.\nMike Bane\nChair of the Board of Directors\n1 Based on interim dividends paid plus change in NAV per share in the year\n2 Pe\nrformance of the portfolio relative to the opening weighted average discount rate as at 31 March 2022", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0c8cec0-cfe6-4994-8605-3c90ae351630": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0c8cec0-cfe6-4994-8605-3c90ae351630", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90848908-a25e-42a4-8cdd-d29391e29371", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "c1ee81c08db956c5e6384c09fc5ab6d6939477c93253664eb5a4ed734890c834"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e8d0892-fa3b-4523-9b7d-e0b642659eef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "619b6a8632a47180b654c99e16b2169c57a0030dba12e4224374522e92fc4e92"}}, "hash": "f7595b07420129493fb01be4f79843226786c34672a6879524ef216126cece3c", "text": "Northwest Parkway  \nsee page 29 Paris-Saclay University\nHICL  Annual Report 20234\nGenerating additional \nshareholder value  \nthrough selective  \ndisposals differentiates  \nHICL\u2019s approach.\nAs HICL carefully navigates this evolving core infrastructure \nlandscape, the Board is confident in InfraRed\u2019s proven ability to identify and capitalise on attractive opportunities that will generate long-term value for our shareholders. \nThe attractive attributes of modern core infrastructure are \nevident in the Company\u2019s acquisitions during the year, which span the electricity transmission, communications and transport sectors. Together, these investments have increased the weighted asset life and inflation correlation of the portfolio, offer predictable income under regulated and contracted frameworks, and have significant growth potential through their strategic positioning with exposure to the powerful growth drivers of the modern economy.\nAcquisitions in the year have significantly contributed \nto our strategy to futureproof HICL \u2019s investment proposition, considering the maturity profile of the Company\u2019s PPP concessions. Since HICL \u2019s first non-PPP investments in early 2016, the Company has materially increased its\u00a0weighted average asset life to 32 years (Sept 2015: 21\u00a0years), increased the portfolio\u2019s inflation correlation to 0.8x (Sept 2015: 0.6x), and substantially increased the long-term forecast investment valuation to\u00a0\u00a32.4bn in 2050 (Sept 2015: \u00a3nil in 2050).\nMaintaining a strong balance sheet in the current \nvolatile market environment is crucial. During the year, the Company demonstrated its ability to raise funding across both debt and equity markets to fund its new acquisitions: \n\u2013\n in J\nuly 2022 HICL activated a \u00a3330m accordion to its \nexisting \u00a3400m Revolving Credit Facility (\u201cRCF\u201d);\n\u2013 in J\nuly 2022 \u00a3160m was raised via an oversubscribed \nand NAV accretive share issue;\u2013 in M\narch 2023 the RCF was renegotiated at a higher \nlevel (\u00a3650m) and with a longer tenor (three years) to \n30 June 2026, maintaining the same margin; and\n\u2013 in M\nay 2023 HICL completed a \u00a3150m Private \nPlacement, effectively converting existing short-term drawings to a longer maturity, reducing interest rate risk and diversifying the Company\u2019s sources of funding.\nThe use of selective disposals as a further source of funding was demonstrated by the sale of Queen Alexandra Hospital (which completed in May 2022) and the partial sale of Northwest Parkway (which was announced after the year-end), both in excess of their holding value. This accretive recycling of capital not only provides an additional source of funding to pursue new investments but improves key portfolio metrics, and supports the Directors\u2019 Valuation.\nDividend guidance\nThe Board is pleased to reconfirm the dividend guidance of 8.25pps for the year to 31 March 2024\n3, and to extend \nthat guidance out for the year ending 31 March 20253 at \nthe same level of 8.25pps. In reaching this decision, the Board recognises the positive impact of inflation on the Company\u2019s portfolio and its cash flows; but also the need to protect the longer-term interests of shareholders and futureproof HICL \u2019s investment proposition.\nSince the Company\u2019s IPO, HICL \u2019s investment strategy \nhas underpinned a compelling total return proposition, of which the dividend has constituted a significant element. HICL \u2019s shareholders have long been \u2018ahead of the curve\u2019, enjoying the highest cash dividend in the immediate core infrastructure peer group for the best part of 20 years. This has been delivered notwithstanding the specific challenges of recent years (e.g. the Carillion liquidation and Covid-19) and the effects of proactively reshaping the portfolio beyond PPP assets to capture longer-term cash flows with greater growth, which tend to initially provide lower yields.\nThe portfolio\u2019s ability to capture inflation, principally in \nthe NAV, has been a defining benefit for investors over the year and has provided significant protection against a higher interest rate environment. Although there is a contractual lag before this inflation increases distributable cash in a significant way, the benefit compounds over time and has significantly enhanced the portfolio\u2019s cash flow and earnings profile over the long term.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e8d0892-fa3b-4523-9b7d-e0b642659eef": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e8d0892-fa3b-4523-9b7d-e0b642659eef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90848908-a25e-42a4-8cdd-d29391e29371", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "c1ee81c08db956c5e6384c09fc5ab6d6939477c93253664eb5a4ed734890c834"}, "2": {"node_id": "a0c8cec0-cfe6-4994-8605-3c90ae351630", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "f7595b07420129493fb01be4f79843226786c34672a6879524ef216126cece3c"}}, "hash": "619b6a8632a47180b654c99e16b2169c57a0030dba12e4224374522e92fc4e92", "text": "Additionally, those specific assets which have seen their distributions temporarily constrained are expected to contribute to cash flows increasingly in time, as are those newer investments with lower initial yields which will serve to bolster dividend cover.

The Board recognises that this confers a responsibility to actively contribute to the \u2018social\u2019 component of the ESG framework, and utilises this lens in the development of the Company\u2019s sustainability strategy. I am pleased to also see the progress made in this area by the Investment Manager, who through their Portfolio Impact team surveyed 61 clients from HICL \u2019s portfolio to gain a deeper insight into asset-specific challenges and satisfaction levels. These responses will flow directly into both targeted and scalable initiatives to deliver improved social outcomes. A more detailed explanation of InfraRed\u2019s sustainability initiatives is given in the Investment Manager\u2019s Report, starting on page 20.\nTo consistently meet sustainability reporting expectations \nand offer accountability to investors requires continuous improvement. Last year InfraRed launched a data collection process to ascertain the greenhouse gas emissions associated with HICL \u2019s entire portfolio, selecting 2019 as the base year to avoid Covid-19 distortion. The Company has now published its first \u2018live\u2019 year of portfolio emissions data, covering 100% of the portfolio and providing investors with tangible data that we can look to improve on going forward. To sit alongside this disclosure, HICL has also published new net zero targets for the portfolio, plotting the path to decarbonising the portfolio by 2050.\nThe Company\u2019s portfolio-wide annual ESG survey has \nbeen expanded again this year, with 95 questions used to capture greater amounts of data. This has enabled HICL to report as an Article 8 fund under the EU\u2019s Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (\u201cSFDR\u201d). Improved data collection and reporting is also a key component of the Company\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) disclosure, which HICL has now been undertaking in full for the past three years.\nAn in-depth review of the Company\u2019s and Investment \nManager\u2019s sustainability performance and ambitions can be found in HICL\u2019s standalone Sustainability Report , \navailable on the Company\u2019s website under Reports & Publications, the highlights of which are on page 36 of this report.Board succession\nIn line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, after nine years on the Board, Frank Nelson will step down in July 2023. Frank was appointed to the Board in 2014 and has served as Senior Independent Director for seven years. I would like to thank Frank for his unwavering support and valued contribution to the Company.\nKenneth Reid will succeed Frank as Senior Independent \nDirector in July 2023, subject to re-election at the 2023 AGM.\nThe Board recognises the significance of having a diverse \nrange of views and experiences to support improved decision-making. The Board composition complies with the recommendations made by the Hampton-Alexander and Parker Reviews as well as the FCA\u2019s Listing Rules, as applicable to closed-end investment companies. Further information can be found in the Report of the Directors \u2013 Diversity Policy on page 90.\nOutlook\nHICL continues to operate in an unpredictable macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Financial markets remain volatile, and the level and timing of peak inflation and interest rates remains uncertain. Against this short-term outlook, the Company\u2019s own valuation assumes a significant decrease in inflation over the coming year, with HICL \u2019s UK RPI forecast returning to 2.75% from April 2024. In isolation, were outturn inflation to be higher than assumed, this would have a positive impact on the Directors\u2019 Valuation.\nInfraRed continues to see strong demand and robust \npricing for high-quality core infrastructure assets, proven by HICL \u2019s recent disposal, activity across other InfraRed-managed funds, and observed market data points. These asset realisations also provide an important alternative source of capital outside of equity and debt markets and enable continued refinement of HICL \u2019s portfolio. Notwithstanding this, the shift in macroeconomic conditions has negatively impacted listed market valuations across real assets and is likely to reduce the Company\u2019s access to equity capital markets in the short term.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32764688-8bc5-43ef-845c-be05355d0703": {"__data__": {"id_": "32764688-8bc5-43ef-845c-be05355d0703", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4b15ab47-3440-42e5-ba99-3d204fde6ca6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "0ef9887371872d03b62911ae6289e84ce3a5f5b0f6b6d2d18323d1fe3ade47d7"}, "2": {"node_id": "cba73fe2-ab19-44ef-9582-f6f9558cca38", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "b52136d6812b51fad5475bb3998a0d33148296f7772588a5101ff232fb7d9c5d"}}, "hash": "fdd38bd55e5f1c1229cf29c5ca7dfc2b017f7a4c0a206c0b239d93c0416a8247", "text": "Looking further ahead, the outlook for the core \ninfrastructure asset class remains buoyant, underpinned by the growth drivers of decarbonisation and digitalisation combined with the growing need to enhance ageing infrastructure.

The World Bank estimates that roughly USD 2.6 trillion is required annually until 2030 in sustainability-related infrastructure spending alone, to meet the UN SDGs and stay on a path to a  \nnet-zero society by 2050.  \n The G20 Global Infrastructure Outlook estimates that the world needs to invest USD  \n94 trillion in infrastructure by 2040 to meet global economic growth and development goals.  \n Underpinning each of these three themes is a fundamental \nneed for infrastructure investment across the world, driven by\u00a0demographic shifts, increasing urbanisation, technological advancement and climate change.\nHICL invests in core infrastructure, the segment of the \ninfrastructure market at the lower end of the risk spectrum, and in line with HICL\u2019s core infrastructure framework (see page 14). Core infrastructure captures those critical assets that underpin the functioning of economies and societies, and therefore represents the most pressing investment need. In the OECD, the core infrastructure sectors in need of investment include transport, healthcare, electricity grid infrastructure and digitalisation. Investment decisions in infrastructure, which are inherently long term, will increasingly be viewed through a\u00a0sustainability lens as developed economies look to harness technology to combat climate change and grow economies.\nDriven by the fundamental trends set out in this section, \nthe\u00a0scale of investment required across HICL\u2019s target sectors and geographies is significant. As a result, the Company expects to benefit from attractive opportunities to\u00a0invest in a range of core infrastructure projects.\n$94 \ntrillion\ninvestment needed to meet  \nglobal economic growth$2.6 trillion\nrequired annually in sustainability-\nrelated infrastructure spending\u00a0  \nto meet the UN SDGs\u00a0$3.7 \ntrillion\nper year of infrastructure  \ninvestment is required globally  \nby 2035\nSources: Please see Appendix 3 on page 159", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4fcf71b-97d2-481a-9dd6-5e5de2652808": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4fcf71b-97d2-481a-9dd6-5e5de2652808", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3787ee10-55c2-4665-8c28-c8b2da4c65bb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "22accaf800474341448db386744de9732d551fb37308c2cdbf7aaf2344837c6c"}}, "hash": "22accaf800474341448db386744de9732d551fb37308c2cdbf7aaf2344837c6c", "text": "Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 202311\n2050\n 2019\n* Europe, North America, Australia and New ZealandPopulation by age group in HICL\u2019s core geographies*\n+49%\nincrease in people aged  \n65+ between 2019 and 2050\n65 or over\nUnder 65In response, investment is required to both \nadequately replace ageing infrastructure, and to adapt infrastructure, old or new, to changing patterns of service delivery, urbanisation and demographic shifts, including rapidly ageing populations across\u00a0developed markets.\nAccording to the OECD, healthcare \nspending for people aged 65 and over is on average 2.7 times higher than for younger age groups.\nGovernment responses acknowledge  \nthe significant task required:\n\u2013\n I\nn the UK, the National Infrastructure \nStrategy (\u201cNIS\u201d) published in November \n2020 outlines a plan for over \u00a3100bn of infrastructure investment over the coming years. In October 2020, the UK government also pledged to build 40 new hospitals by 2030 with a total cost of close to \u00a34bn. Though subsequently pared back, this indicates the significant need for new critical social infrastructure. In April 2021, the UK government also announced a commitment to invest \u00a31.8bn in the construction of new educational facilities.\u2013\n  I n 2021, the European Union launched \nthe Recovery and Resilience Facility (\u201cRRF\u201d), which allows the European Commission to raise funds that are used to help Member States implement investments that are in line with the EU\u2019s priorities. To date, the RRF has allocated over \u20ac10bn to social infrastructure.\n\u2013\n E\nuropean countries including France, \nGermany and the Netherlands continue to use the PPP model to develop new social infrastructure, with c.\u20ac3.36bn of new opportunities in the healthcare and education spaces launched across the region between 2020 \u2013 2022.\n\u2013\n I\nn the US, the American Jobs Plan \n(2021) aims to invest $2.3tn in a variety of infrastructure projects, including $400bn for expanding access to affordable care for elderly and disabled Americans and $100bn for building and upgrading public schools. PPPs (known as P3s) are expected to be a key delivery mechanism for these investments.From schools and hospitals to police and fire stations, \nsocial infrastructure assets are critical to the functioning of communities and play a crucial role in the global economy. As new technologies emerge, existing assets decay and the needs of societies shift over time, upgrading and building new social infrastructure is critical to people\u2019s quality of life.\nWith net zero targets high on the \nagenda of most developed nations, there is a growing need to decarbonise existing social infrastructure. This is expected to create opportunities for additional investment in existing facilities, working alongside public sector clients. A report produced by the New Economics Foundation in September 2022 found that private investment in carbon-reduction activities would need to increase by \u00a3140bn over the next five years if the UK is to reach its net zero targets.Strong social  \nfoundations \nSources: Please see Appendix 3 on page 159", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "246c756f-a978-4e10-b96d-5ddbc45740ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "246c756f-a978-4e10-b96d-5ddbc45740ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "547a2b15-cd9b-4bab-8c6c-3b2cc46835d2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "c5f2205d9372f6ee06f85d899b9f595dfeaf93d4b96daa0923c290b2974c2747"}}, "hash": "c5f2205d9372f6ee06f85d899b9f595dfeaf93d4b96daa0923c290b2974c2747", "text": "HICL  Annual Report 202312\nData consumption\nData volume in zetabytes\nNew Zealand*UK\nGermanyIreland\nAustralia*Finland\nAustriaNetherlandsFranceDenmarkPortugal\nSweden\nNorwaySpain\n2010 2025The Infrastructure Market continued\nPolicy responses across HICL\u2019s markets \nrecognise the additional investment required and include:\n\u2013\n T\nhe EU\u2019s Gigabit Society vision, under \nwhich all households in the EU should \nhave access to internet connection speeds at least 100Mb/s by 2025.

The trends of ageing infrastructure and decarbonisation continue to drive the need for funding in this space. \nPolicy responses recognising  \nthis need include:\n\u2013\n T\nhe US Bipartisan Infrastructure \nInvestment and Jobs Act was made \neffective in 2021 and allocates over $110bn to repairing ageing roads and bridges. Much of this infrastructure across these markets will be delivered by private capital through established funding mechanisms, with operating models at the lower end of the infrastructure risk spectrum.\n\u2013\n I\nn March 2020, as part of its budget, \nthe UK government pledged \u00a3640bn of infrastructure investment between 2020 and 2025. This was followed by the government setting forth its intention to earmark \u00a327bn of funds against a new road investment strategy.\n\u2013\n T\nhe EU\u2019s target of becoming carbon \nneutral by 2050 is expected to prompt substantial investments in the rail and rolling stock sectors as low-carbon transport mediums supported by the rollout of electric, hydrogen and hybrid trains. These investments should also help the EU achieve its goal of reducing transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 90% before 2050,  \nwhich was established in 2020  \nas part\u00a0of the European  \nGreen Deal.Infrastructure that connects communities, such as \nroads,\u00a0bridges and digital communication networks, plays a vital role in driving development, connecting people to employment and education and is fundamental\u00a0to our social wellbeing.Connecting  \ncommunities \nCommunications\nVirtually all aspects of our lives are \nbecoming increasingly digitised over time, with the amount of data copied, captured and consumed worldwide projected to show a 182% increase by 2025 relative to the 2020 level. As such, there is a significant requirement for upgraded digital infrastructure to meet these new needs. In many mature geographies, the availability of full fibre connections to homes and businesses remains nascent, lagging behind the demands of modern economies and requiring substantial capex investment to upgrade.\nThe roll-out of fibre broadband varies \nsignificantly by country, with different strategies and regulatory frameworks employed by national governments to meet connectivity objectives. In general, countries with mature regulatory regimes, concession-based frameworks and subsidised rural networks, such as France, provide the most suitable geographies for core infrastructure investment as they offer long-term cash flow visibility and have low or no risk of overbuild.\nDevelopment of tower infrastructure, \nsupporting mobile connectivity, is also expected to grow substantially due to the rollout of 5G and material increases in mobile data consumption. Whilst some geographies are well advanced, others such as New Zealand are earlier in the 5G journey and require a significant increase in tower capacity over the next 5 to 10 years.\n* For supplementary notes and sources, please see Appendix 3 on page 159+182%\nGrowth in data  \nconsumption from  \n2020 \u2013 2025Fibre penetration and 5G \npenetration by country\n5G Coverage as a % of population (as of October 2022) \nFTTP Coverage \u2013 Homes  \npassed as a proportion  \nof total households (as  \nof September 2022)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eecab295-07f8-47c2-bdbe-d9ad87f0cdbc": {"__data__": {"id_": "eecab295-07f8-47c2-bdbe-d9ad87f0cdbc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "92a4fbf9-98e9-4617-b6ab-41ddb3e0ba61", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "7f358c0e81d73995a87f7a523c54c9f361c509a493ca10c6233b0b8cd56ef561"}}, "hash": "7f358c0e81d73995a87f7a523c54c9f361c509a493ca10c6233b0b8cd56ef561", "text": "\u00a351bn \nOfwat announced a \u00a351bn \nspending package to improve the resilience of the UK water network and promote environmental sustainability\nOverview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 202313\nRenewa ble energy\nTraditional uses of Biomas\nNon-renewable electricity\nFossil fuels and otherDecarbonisation\nWhile decarbonisation is the long-term \ndriver, energy strategy in developed markets is also materially driven by increased concerns in the short term over energy security (due to geopolitical uncertainty), and energy affordability (cost of living concerns) \u2013 together the \u2018energy trilemma\u2019. This is expected to continue to drive significant investment in energy infrastructure, in particular across the breadth of the breadth of the electricity system.\nAddressing this trilemma requires new \nsources of green electricity supply, substantial shifts in electricity demand due to the decarbonisation of heat and transport, and substantially evolved grid infrastructure to deal with both.\nIn the UK and US alone, we estimate an \ninvestment need in energy transmission and distribution of USD 2.5 trillion, alongside USD 600bn to achieve the decarbonisation of heat and USD 110bn for the decarbonisation of transport. A recent report by the Energy Transitions Commission, estimates around USD 1.1 trillion a year is required to be spent on grid and storage globally out to 2050, versus USD 260bn a year currently.Policy responses across HICL\u2019s markets recognise the challenge ahead and have introduced a range of initiatives to develop key infrastructure including:\n\u2013\n T\nhe US Inflation Reduction Act (\u201cIRA\u201d) \nsigned in 2022 allocates USD 386bn of \nfunding to energy and climate spending. \n\u2013\n T\nhe EU\u2019s European Green Deal, (2020) \nlegally enshrined net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with at least 55% of emissions reduced by 2030 relative to 1990 levels. A crucial element of the package is significant investment in the reach and resilience of electricity grids.\n\u2013\n I\nn the UK\u2019s Infrastructure Delivery Plan \n(2016), strategic priorities include the delivery of electricity interconnectors and an update to the transmission and distribution network. The smart meter roll-out programme sees a requirement for\u00a085% of homes connected by 2024.\n\u2013\n I\nn 2020, Ofgem proposed up to \u00a335bn \nupfront funding to improve the UK energy network, accommodating for greener energy, in line with the UK\u2019s Net\u00a0Zero Strategy.\n\u2013\n I\nn 2022, Germany launched its \u20ac3bn \nsubsidy scheme that will support the development of new district heating systems using a minimum of 75% renewable energy and the decarbonisation of existing networks until 2028.Sustainable  \nmodern  \neconomiesIn the face of a changing climate, sustainable modern \neconomies need to increasingly manage essential resource scarcity (e.g. water) and the transition to a low-carbon economy. Significant investment in the generation, transmission, distribution and storage of clean energy is\u00a0essential to deliver net zero target by 2050.\nResource scarcity\nKey challenges faced by the UK water \nsystem include the need to ensure drought resilience, improve water quality and combat water pollution. These challenges can be addressed only with significant levels of investment into the nation\u2019s water infrastructure.\nIn 2019, Ofwat announced a \u00a351bn \nspending package to improve the

HICL \u2019s Public Private Partnership (\u201cPPP\u201d) portfolio (60% of the Directors\u2019 Valuation at 31 March 2023; 66% at 31 March 2022) performed well during the period, benefiting from the inflation linkage built into its availability-based contracted revenues and highly contracted cost base, including fixed debt over the life of the project. \nThe Company\u2019s three largest demand-based \ninvestments (17% of the Directors\u2019 Valuation at 31 March 2023; 22% at 31 March 2022), together experienced traffic broadly in line with valuation assumptions for the year. Wider economic volatility has not had any material impact on the performance of these investments in the year, helped by their strategically significant locations and entrenched demand.\nThe operational performance of the Company\u2019s largest \nregulated investment, Affinity Water (7% of the Directors\u2019 Valuation at 31 March 2023; 9% at 31 March 2022), was negatively impacted by unusually adverse weather conditions during the year which resulted in increased operating costs and incentive regime penalties. This was offset by the positive impact of actual and forecast inflation, as well as the reflection of Ofwat\u2019s final PR24 methodology and early view on the allowed return on capital for the next Asset Management Plan period (2025 \u2013 2030). \nFollowing the completion of Fortysouth (formerly known \nas Aotearoa Towers) during the year, InfraRed has been working closely with One NZ\n3 to oversee the transition \nof the passive infrastructure. Operational and financial performance over the period was in line with HICL \u2019s acquisition assumptions. HICL \u2019s investment in Texas Nevada Transmission completed after the year-end, and the business has been performing well since the commitment was made in summer 2022. InfraRed\u2019s local asset management teams are working closely with both companies to ensure a smooth transition into the HICL portfolio. \nEnhanced disclosure on the operational performance \nof each of HICL \u2019s Top 10 assets is set out starting on page 26. HICL\u2019s business model \ndelivering\u00a0value\nThe proactive management of the Company\u2019s balance \nsheet and portfolio composition is central to HICL \u2019s business model. \nProactive balance sheet management\nDisciplined management of the Company\u2019s funding position remains a priority. In March 2023, the Company\u2019s Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) was renegotiated to increase its capacity to \u00a3650m and to extend the tenor to 30 June 2026. This replaced the existing \u00a3400m RCF and \u00a3330m accordion, which was activated in July 2022 to support the Company\u2019s attractive short-term investment pipeline. The new facility, which remains sustainability linked, provides substantial funding resources and sufficient tenor to support the Company\u2019s strategy.\nIn May 2023, HICL issued a \u00a3150m Private Placement, \nfurther diversifying the Company\u2019s sources of capital. Proceeds of the issue will be used to reduce drawings on the Company\u2019s RCF, and extend the maturity and reduce the interest rate risk on the equivalent drawings. The maturity aligns with the forecast capital returns from HICL \u2019s PPP portfolio to enable the Company to reinvest this capital ahead of time.\nHICL \u2019s capitalisation was also supported by an accretive \nequity issuance in July 2022 that raised \u00a3160m and was subject to scale back. The continued demand from institutional and retail shareholders demonstrates the support for HICL \u2019s strategy and appetite for the key attributes of core infrastructure.\nAccretive investment activity\nAcquisition and disposal activity in the year served to improve portfolio composition, enhance diversification and contribute significantly to the Company\u2019s strategy to increase asset life and long-term earnings generation within the portfolio. \nThree high-quality investments were announced in the \nyear, which comprised:\n\u2013\n Fo\nrtysouth (New Zealand), a passive mobile tower \ninfrastructure owner with over 1,500 towers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5e09e60-28fd-49f1-9609-16e718178bac": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5e09e60-28fd-49f1-9609-16e718178bac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77e7c5ce-01a6-4a39-be20-a23f9e9ce27e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "6fb6f94d4768f0a7a97af1335779d9cfdb2d4169eff3597863d8a0d3de78552f"}, "2": {"node_id": "89cfc68d-0e40-4ead-9545-c4e68234d21e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "4149cf10c137f4abdb84078f7ae3ce2a5b343ddc61b5ba61f40a651bd265460c"}}, "hash": "bc1537c9b45c51a51ea1c7ea9517cf4aad15d62e6a1c58b49551c84a853389b3", "text": "Completed in November 2022 (6% of the Directors\u2019 Valuation);\n\u2013\n Cr\noss London Trains (\u201cXLT\u201d) (UK), a PPP asset \ncomprising 115 electrified trains.

This positioning extends to the robustness of the investments\u2019 capital structures, with limited refinancing risk, as well as broader protection from the risk of higher interest rates through inflation-linked cash flows and, in the case of TNT, a regulated cost of capital. In an environment of elevated inflation and interest rates, assets that provide these protections are particularly attractive. These investments were delivered through InfraRed\u2019s deep global relationships, innovative approach to bidding and strong track record for execution.\nThe transaction activity further demonstrates the \nevolution of core infrastructure and the compelling set of investment opportunities arising from modernising global economies. In particular, the megatrends of digitisation and decarbonisation provide tailwinds that are expected to support long-term growth in these recent investments, funded from the assets\u2019 existing capital resources. \nAlongside accretive investments, asset disposals provide \nan important lever to optimise portfolio construction, realise NAV outperformance and provide a valuable source of funding for the Company. In the year, HICL completed the disposal of its 100% interest in the Queen Alexandra Hospital (\u201cQAH\u201d) PPP project, generating 1.5p of NAV outperformance and \u00a3108m of proceeds which were subsequently invested into the accretive acquisitions described above.\nFollowing the year end, HICL executed an agreement \nto sell 10% of its 33.3% shareholding in the Northwest Parkway for a consideration of USD 86m, achieving a small premium to carrying value. This sale crystallised a\u00a011.0% holding period IRR since the initial investment in December 2016 and a 1.8x multiple on cash invested, demonstrating the continued ability of the Company to deliver capital growth and compound shareholder returns. As well as providing a valuable source of funding, the transaction supported the Directors\u2019 Valuation in a period of macroeconomic uncertainty. Not least, the disposal crystallised the significant valuation appreciation since acquisition to effectively rotate capital and optimise HICL \u2019s diversification by sector, geography and revenue type.Specialist asset management \nInfraRed\u2019s dedicated team of specialist asset managers is key to the delivery of investment performance through the investment lifecycle. The proficient onboarding of new acquisitions has been a critical asset management activity in the year, delivered via InfraRed\u2019s asset management platforms out of London, New York and Sydney.\nInfraRed\u2019s long track record of successfully delivering \nassets through construction was demonstrated in the period. On 1 July 2022, Paris-Saclay University commenced operations in line with the agreed availability date, marking the conclusion of a four-year construction period.

This means that if inflation were 1% above assumptions each and every year in the future, the return from the portfolio would be expected to increase by 0.8%. Increases in inflation expectations are reflected immediately in the Company\u2019s NAV. However, the effect of inflation on future portfolio earnings is not linear and takes time to make a meaningful impact on distributable cash in the short term, and it is also affected by the contractual lags to implement inflationary uplifts. Accordingly, it is important to look at total return (NAV movement plus dividends) to evaluate the impact of inflation correlation.\nOverview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 202323\nHighlights\n1.31x/ \n1.03x\nDividend cash \ncover\n66%\nPortfolio company gearing\nArticle 8 \nHICL\u2019s SFDR  \nfund alignmentFinancial highlights\nNAV per share increased by 1.8p over the year to 164.9p at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: 163.1p). \nThe movement in the NAV per share in the year was \nlargely attributable to the portfolio\u2019s strong inflation correlation. The positive portfolio performance was offset by the valuation impact of an increase in the weighted average portfolio discount rate to 7.2% at 31 March 2023 (6.6% at 31 March 2022). The weighted average discount rate was increased to recognise elevated government bond yields throughout the jurisdictions in which HICL invests, as central banks increased benchmark rates in reaction to high levels of inflation. There was no material impact to financial performance from rising interest rates. Overall, HICL \u2019s portfolio company gearing, which stands at 66%, is predominantly fixed-rate and the Company has limited sensitivity to rising interest rates (see NAV sensitivity chart on page 50). \nDividend guidance\nThe Board\u2019s extended dividend guidance has been developed with the full support of the Investment Manager. Significant strides have been made in recent years to diversify, and extend, the Company\u2019s revenue streams through both acquisitions and disposals. These activities have sought to strike an appropriate balance between maintaining HICL \u2019s high dividend (in relative terms), prioritising capital preservation and building an enduring platform for long-term NAV appreciation and dividend growth. \nTo date this strategy has been carried out effectively. \nSince HICL acquired its first non-PPP investments in early 2016, the Company\u2019s weighted average asset life has increased by over 50%, while inflation correlation has increased by over 30% to 0.8x over the same timeframe. The latter has served to provide significant protection to investors over the past year, offsetting the negative impact of higher interest/discount rates on the portfolio valuation while also considerably enhancing HICL \u2019s future earnings and cash flow profile. All the while, the Company has continued to pay out the highest dividend in the core infrastructure peer group.\nShort-term distributable cash continues to recover, \nas reflected in the further increase in dividend cash cover (1.03x before profits on disposals), and HICL \u2019s asset life is now the highest in its history. Nevertheless, this period of consolidation remains in progress and accordingly InfraRed supports the decision to maintain the dividend at 8.25pps for the year ending 31 March 2025. The dividend is a material component of HICL \u2019s total return profile which, when coupled with high inflation correlation, the long-term visibility of portfolio cash flows and potential for NAV growth, provides a compelling investment proposition for shareholders.Funding position\nAs at 31 March the Company\u2019s investment entity subsidiary, IILP, was \u00a3219m drawn on its RCF, with \u00a316m of short-term commitments at that date. Following year-end transactions, including the completion of TNT, the completion of Altitude Infra, the agreed partial disposal of NWP, the Private Placement proceeds and the expected investment in the Hornsea II OFTO, the Company is expected to have drawn c.\u00a3360m on its RCF.\nFurther information on the investment valuation and \nfinancial performance can be found in Valuation of the Portfolio starting on page 46, and the Financial Review starting on page 40.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afbeb9a8-d4bc-437d-8fad-345534a8c4ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "afbeb9a8-d4bc-437d-8fad-345534a8c4ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "07580091-5677-411d-9e15-d4b8cf95428f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "883acd13ac9203ed4c787e3f4f82088e53ae91b5400c357f558f22552419c01c"}, "2": {"node_id": "b458b78d-5800-4ac7-af31-118076ff9aa5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "78c586fb4cc18048972f38746a6504a032e562515f80516a494b88b4974f7a63"}}, "hash": "e3ff7278500cb6fd3bc3f3eddd88fabb8fdaca4ef1fe406543f6dcc0522adee7", "text": "Governance\nThe Board continues to deliver its succession plan, with Frank Nelson, HICL \u2019s Senior Independent Director (SID), planning to step down in July 2023.

By facilitating the delivery of essential services in a socially responsible manner, the Company\u2019s underlying assets contribute to many of the UN SDGs and deliver an inherent social good. However, a genuine social contribution requires going beyond the reliable provision of infrastructure. To that extent, InfraRed has created a dedicated Portfolio Impact team and strategy which aims to drive positive social outcomes for local communities and to enhance relationships with public and private sector clients.\nDuring the year, InfraRed published its net zero \nprogress report setting out interim targets for all funds, incorporating a proportion of HICL \u2019s portfolio which is aligned or aligning to net zero. Within this framework, HICL has disclosed its own interim targets, and the entire portfolio is expected to align with InfraRed\u2019s pledge of achieving net zero by 2050 or earlier. \nSupporting these initiatives and in line with HICL \u2019s active \nsustainability strategy, the Investment Manager has achieved key milestones in data collection and disclosure in the year for the Company. InfraRed\u2019s expanded annual ESG survey has enabled HICL to expand its suite of sustainability metrics and targets to include all mandatory PAI\n4 indicators under the EU\u2019s SFDR regime, \nan important part of the Company\u2019s wider disclosure as an Article 8 fund.\nSustainability Highlights are provided on pages 36 \n\u2013 37.

The Company is not directly exposed to the region, either via its investment portfolio or its shareholder register. The secondary impacts of the conflict, including supply chain disruption, increased energy costs and materials inflation have had a limited impact on a subset of projects during the period, with risks to equity mitigated through contractual pass-through mechanisms. Political risk also manifested in the UK, with two changes of Prime Minister in the year. The political situation has since stabilised, with the next general election to be held no later than January 2025. The broader need for infrastructure procurement enjoys bipartisan political support, though specific areas of policy focus undoubtedly vary. The Investment Manager continues to judge UK political risk as low. Notwithstanding that, the rationale for portfolio diversification, including across clients, sectors and countries, remains strong and is a key feature of HICL \u2019s offering and strategy.\nPFI handback\nThe process whereby PFI projects revert to public ownership is expected to gather momentum over the next decade. Ensuring the smooth transition of assets over time is therefore a prominent issue for all PFI stakeholders, public and private sectors alike. InfraRed enjoys representation in the IPA\u2019s dedicated working group on this project, as well as the IPA\u2019s equity sponsor steering group, and a HICL asset participated in an IPA-sponsored mid-life contractual review in the year. The Investment Manager launched its own rolling programme of handback preparedness reviews, which focuses initially on the 29 projects due to be handed back in the next ten years (representing 11% of the Directors\u2019 Valuation at 31 March 2023). This exercise will guide InfraRed\u2019s planning and asset management design around this risk. \nClient relationships\nThere continue to be risks inherent in long-term partnership frameworks, particularly in the context of broader operating and financial pressures across the UK public sector. In specific cases this has resulted in more adversarial forms of contract management, particularly in a subset of the Company\u2019s UK healthcare projects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc55e17a-5479-4a31-853c-94765c95e1fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc55e17a-5479-4a31-853c-94765c95e1fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a39793e8-83aa-4c75-855c-42bd26960fe0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "4e113ca06fbb6ec0498bd6dfd5e069119e438f08e1806cbcdd7165658078afb6"}, "2": {"node_id": "0579368f-ed96-4610-98bd-6af2693e4ce4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "26", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "32ccf43d90dd628b5dbd11666f5cc6926fcdf020a4252ad471ae4cd1aa92adf3"}}, "hash": "f27156f584232bc1f28739daa425d40b8cc1e46d33b5a13474541243f96626d2", "text": "Though this remains immaterial to the portfolio, the risk for further instances of this behaviour exists, including the non-payment of contracted revenues, which could pose a risk to the Company\u2019s cash flow. \n4 Principal Adverse Impact\nAffinity Water  \nsee page 26 HS1 see page 32", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df7e881e-4b1d-4668-a0ed-9a8bf99bc6c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "df7e881e-4b1d-4668-a0ed-9a8bf99bc6c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4bc2c50a-8235-49bd-9f0f-0631e8d64166", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "7807d4e7932e788b8a5608cd3a598d333f5c99f580d255df167179ebcad85b9a"}, "3": {"node_id": "9aa77a1f-357d-4190-830c-8a1ef00c222e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "ba3d8e2f8ec39f48b020371374fec971c4ccbe03a0f0fbcdec95d8f19c4065e4"}}, "hash": "3eb617a2219d2453813e82f5e42a259188d8a818d9f8b0d1fc99a404cbed2cc2", "text": "Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 202325\n10.5p\nThe increase in \nNAV per share if inflation is 3% above HICL\u2019s assumptions for the next three yearsRegulation\nThe Company has six assets classified as being subject to regulatory oversight, though the nature and extent of this varies significantly across the assets.

This has enabled a greater degree of visibility over potential long-term fluctuations to usage patterns, driven by factors such as shifting working patterns as a result of Covid-19 and the decarbonisation of transport. An estimate of this impact has been incorporated into the long-term revenue forecasts for Northwest Parkway and HS1. Risk remains that current demand forecasts do not accurately reflect shifts in usage patterns for HICL \u2019s demand-based assets. The strategic positioning, long traffic histories and entrenched demand enjoyed by HICL \u2019s demand-based assets mitigates this risk.\nMacroeconomic risk\nThe returns from HICL \u2019s core infrastructure portfolio are significantly positively correlated to inflation at 0.8x over the long term. Recognising the current high inflationary environment, NAV and cash flow sensitivities have been calculated. Where inflation is higher than HICL \u2019s valuation assumptions by 3% for the next three years, NAV would increase by 10.5p per share.\nDiscount rates used to value core infrastructure assets \ndid not fully reflect the significant decrease in risk-free rates observed over the last decade, serving to increase the implied equity risk premium to historically high levels. This anticipation of a normalisation of the interest rate environment insulated the portfolio valuation from the full impact of the volatility of risk-free rates. Notwithstanding this, HICL increased its weighted average discount rate by 60bps over the year. The current implied equity risk premium of 3.5% remains appropriate and commensurate with HICL \u2019s risk positioning and long track record of delivering for shareholders.Market and outlook \nDuring a period of heightened geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, the Company\u2019s portfolio has again demonstrated its resilience. Volatile periods such as this serve to underscore the importance of the disciplined portfolio construction and expert diversification that underpin HICL \u2019s continued ability to\u00a0deliver long-term outperformance.\nThe Company is well positioned to continue delivering its \nstrategy. HICL \u2019s strong inflation linkage, prudent approach to managing its balance sheet and established track record of delivering yield and capital growth, ensure that HICL remains a compelling all-weather investment and a\u00a0valuable diversifier for investor portfolios. \nInfraRed continues to identify and pursue opportunities \nto manage portfolio composition and improve key portfolio metrics through highly selective acquisitions and disposals. In this task, InfraRed remains focused on ensuring that HICL is well positioned for the future as its PPP concessions approach their capital redemption phase. This necessitates proactive management, and careful consideration of the relative merits of short-term yield as against an enhanced longer-term earnings profile, such that HICL continues to deliver its compelling investment proposition for decades to come.\nThe Company\u2019s vision, to deliver strong social \nfoundations, connect communities and support sustainable modern economies guides HICL \u2019s investment ambition. This vision connects with powerful megatrends of digitalisation and decarbonisation (see Infrastructure Market section on pages 10-13) which continue to drive infrastructure development and provide significant opportunity for investment. Strong investment discipline, aided by HICL \u2019s core infrastructure framework (see page 14), and InfraRed\u2019s differentiated capability to source opportunities, stand the Company in good stead to deliver its strategy. \nHICL has a portfolio of diversified assets with attractive \ncore infrastructure characteristics, in a sector buoyed by powerful growth drivers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9aa77a1f-357d-4190-830c-8a1ef00c222e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9aa77a1f-357d-4190-830c-8a1ef00c222e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4bc2c50a-8235-49bd-9f0f-0631e8d64166", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "7807d4e7932e788b8a5608cd3a598d333f5c99f580d255df167179ebcad85b9a"}, "2": {"node_id": "df7e881e-4b1d-4668-a0ed-9a8bf99bc6c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "3eb617a2219d2453813e82f5e42a259188d8a818d9f8b0d1fc99a404cbed2cc2"}}, "hash": "ba3d8e2f8ec39f48b020371374fec971c4ccbe03a0f0fbcdec95d8f19c4065e4", "text": "Together these underscore the compelling nature of HICL \u2019s investment proposition today and into the future.\nDownload the HICL  \nSustainability Report online www.HICL.com", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c431615f-378d-4516-98ea-3fe201eb6ffc": {"__data__": {"id_": "c431615f-378d-4516-98ea-3fe201eb6ffc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "66009f78-0c4e-451b-8401-85079391fe30", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "28", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "f5fd4974cb93f4f02ca2792ecec413cae72d1c0e13d94f2be6944aebf53e6085"}}, "hash": "f5fd4974cb93f4f02ca2792ecec413cae72d1c0e13d94f2be6944aebf53e6085", "text": "HICL  Annual Report 202326\nTop 10 assets1 \u2013 \noperational highlights\nI am delighted to join \nAffinity Water as CEO, particularly at such an important time in the regulatory period...Affinity is a business with huge potential.\nKeith Haslett \nCEO, Affinity Water1. Affinity Water\nAffinity Water provides on average 950 million litres \nof clean water each day to a population of more than 3.6 million people in southern and eastern England. As a regulated utility, the company has clear visibility over its appointed revenue base through a well-established price review mechanism.\nOn 13 December 2022 Ofwat published its final \nmethodology for the upcoming periodic price review in 2024 (PR24), which included an early view of the allowed return on capital (\u201cWACC\u201d), and on 20 March 2023 it released its decision on licence modifications to promote financial resilience. Together, these increase visibility over Affinity Water\u2019s business plan for PR24. Ofwat\u2019s methodology represents a gradual evolution from the PR19 approach and is expected to result in significant growth in the company\u2019s Regulatory Capital Value as a result of substantial increases in total expenditure allowances. The final PR24 methodology, early view on WACC and PR24 licence amendment have been reflected in HICL \u2019s valuation of Affinity Water as at 31 March 2023 and had a small positive impact in aggregate. Free cash flows are currently being reinvested into capital growth, with shareholder distributions expected to resume in\u00a0the next regulatory period.\nOperational performance over the year was slightly behind \nexpectations as a result of extreme hot weather during the summer of 2022 and freeze-thaw conditions in December 2022. Both of these events resulted in increased operating costs and revenue penalties. Operating costs were also affected by high energy prices during the year, although the financial impact was substantially mitigated as a result of the company\u2019s hedging strategy. \nDespite the challenging external environment, Affinity Water \ndid not impose usage restrictions at any point during the year, achieved its FY2023 leakage target, and is on track to deliver a 20% reduction in leakage by 2025. This represents the most ambitious target of all water companies in England for the current regulatory period. \nOn 8 December 2022, Ofwat published its annual \nassessment of operational performance and a summary of the financial resilience of the sector\n1. Affinity Water\u2019s \noperational performance ranked in the top half of all companies, with Ofwat highlighting a sector-leading improvement in per-capita water consumption. This reflects the management team\u2019s focus on the sustainable use of natural resources. Affinity Water\u2019s financial structure has benefited from steadily reduced levels of gearing over the current regulatory period, which was reflected in Ofwat\u2019s report. \nIn January 2023, Keith Haslett joined Affinity Water as \nCEO, having previously served as Group Water Director at Northumbrian Water. InfraRed worked closely with the Affinity Water board throughout the recruitment process and will continue to support Keith as he leads the business into the next regulatory period.\nSector:  \u00a0Electricity & Water\nLocation:  UK\n% of portfolio: 7% (March 2022: 9%)\nHICL holding:  33.2%\nConcession life remaining:  Indefinite\nStatus:  Operational\n1 www.ofwat.gov.uk/publication/water-company-performance-report-2021-22/", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97a7e962-c49a-40e8-80c5-69265b00987f": {"__data__": {"id_": "97a7e962-c49a-40e8-80c5-69265b00987f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "371d1590-f696-4194-a5e5-65044d3edd57", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "b98a959a58158f0cf282b4a5c34ce44b003d9287b25654874fbec8fd53909964"}}, "hash": "b98a959a58158f0cf282b4a5c34ce44b003d9287b25654874fbec8fd53909964", "text": "Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 202327\nInvesting in  \ninfrastructure:\n20%\nleakage reduction  \nby 2025\nEnriching lives:\n950m \nlitres \nclean water dailyproviding on average 950 million litres  \nof clean water each day to a population  \nof more than 3.6 million people Clean \nwater", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8b6b694-86b2-43cf-964b-13aef7cee23b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8b6b694-86b2-43cf-964b-13aef7cee23b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bc6fe9bb-7e74-4547-ac89-c4af90d85601", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "6c63f2e21d7a43f14afdcea73b0f018e4b32e28cd4b66c9c0195b07cb6f87a98"}}, "hash": "6c63f2e21d7a43f14afdcea73b0f018e4b32e28cd4b66c9c0195b07cb6f87a98", "text": "28 HICL  Annual Report 2023\n2. A63 Motorway\nHICL\u2019s investment relates to a 105km \nstretch of the A63 Autoroute in France, which connects Bordeaux to the Spanish border. \nThe road is an important trans-European \ntransport corridor for both freight and leisure travel, enabling journeys from the Iberian Peninsula and south-western France to the whole of northern Europe. \nIn the year to 31 March 2023, light vehicle \ntraffic was 9.6% higher than in the previous year, with heavy vehicle traffic broadly flat over the same period. Overall, this resulted in total traffic levels and distributions slightly ahead of HICL \u2019s valuation assumption. The management team closely monitored the potential impact of several external factors during the year including industrial action, increased fuel prices, and reduced economic activity. Encouragingly, none of these had a material impact on performance, reinforcing the road\u2019s strategic positioning. In February 2023, toll rates were increased by an average of 6.2%, reflecting the inflationary environment in France and protecting revenues in real terms. \nA major programme of carriageway \nresurfacing was completed on schedule in November 2022. The works were undertaken in line with the long-term maintenance plan for the asset, and the total cost was broadly in line with HICL \u2019s valuation assumption despite supply chain pressures linked to inflation.\nDuring the year, the portfolio company \ninstalled a contactless payment system.

In the short term however, recovery is likely to take slightly longer than previously forecast as a result of changing commuter travel patterns and the consequential level of congestion on alternative routes. Overall, the new traffic forecast had a modest negative impact on the valuation as at 31 March 2023, with a return to pre-Covid levels now expected in June 2025.

Fortysouth \nFortysouth is the largest independent \nmobile tower operator in New Zealand. With over 1,500 wholly owned towers covering 98% of New Zealand\u2019s population, Fortysouth enables mobile network operators, fixed wireless providers, and critical communications operators to deliver communications services that connect New Zealanders to\u00a0each other, and the world.\nFollowing the completion of the transaction on \n1 November 2023, InfraRed has been working closely with One NZ to oversee the carve-out process of the passive infrastructure, which includes the physical towers, masts and poles. One NZ and other telecommunications providers will retain responsibility for the \u2018active\u2019 equipment. Fortysouth has a fully formed executive management team with a wealth of operational, financial and commercial experience. During the period, InfraRed oversaw a process to appoint an independent non-executive chair, who will sit on the board of the company alongside senior asset managers from InfraRed, Northleaf and One NZ.\nOperational and financial performance over \nthe period was in line with HICL \u2019s acquisition case. The company\u2019s revenues are principally derived from a long-term, availability-based contract with One NZ, which has an initial term of 20 years with the option of two ten-year extensions. The agreement grants One NZ access to the passive tower infrastructure in exchange for contractual, inflation-linked access charge payments that are unrelated to usage and currently account for 96% of revenues. Extreme weather in New Zealand in\u00a0early 2023 did not materially impact day-to-day operational performance, despite broader transport and supply chain disruption.Under the terms of the carve-out process, responsibility for the deployment and upgrade of towers currently sits with One NZ, which has contractually committed to 390 additional sites over the next ten years and is currently on schedule. This provides a high degree of visibility over medium-term growth in Fortysouth\u2019s asset base and revenues.

Together, the networks consist of over 800km of high-voltage transmission lines, as well as a number of switching stations and substations, which have been fully operational since 2014.\nIn the period following HICL \u2019s commitment to the asset in \nSeptember 2022, InfraRed has deepened its relationship with co-owner and operator LS Power, a highly-reputable owner, operator and developer of transmission and generation assets in North America. HICL successfully completed the transaction after the year end, having obtained relevant third-party approvals, and senior members of InfraRed\u2019s Asset Management team have conducted a site visit and initial liaison meeting with key LS\u00a0Power staff. \nOperational performance has been in line with HICL \u2019s acquisition \nassumptions to date. Both networks performed well over the winter months, achieving full availability despite some winter storm events in Texas. CTT benefits from a stable regulatory regime, which operates under a cost-of-service recovery model. This affords a high level of cash flow visibility, as well as inherent protection against increases in discount rates or financing costs through the regulatory return on capital. ON Line receives long-term contracted cash flows under a Transmission Use Agreement with NV Energy (A-rated), an indirect subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. which holds a c.25% economic interest in the business.\nTNT\u2019s transmission infrastructure is expected to play a key role \nin the energy transition as the US build-out of renewables is accelerated. CTT procured under Texas\u2019s Competitive Renewable Energy Zone programme in 2009, a regional transmission expansion plan designed to unlock grid capacity constraints and facilitate the future build of renewable generation in the state. Currently, CTT has over 900 MWs of wind generation connected to its system, and the forecast roll-out of renewable generation is expected to provide significant opportunity for growth of the transmission infrastructure over the long term.5.

High Speed 1 \nHigh Speed 1 (\u201cHS1\u201d) is the UK\u2019s only \nhigh-speed rail line, linking London St Pancras with the Channel Tunnel. It is a vital component of the UK\u2019s rail link with Continental Europe, and also enables fast and frequent domestic rail services between Kent and Greater London.\nIn the year to 31 March 2023, international \ntrain path bookings were at 79% of pre-Covid levels on average. This was slightly ahead of HICL \u2019s valuation assumption, buoyed by the rapid return of leisure travellers, and resulted in total revenue from international train paths growing c.200% year-on-year. Eurostar also resumed the practice of booking the vast majority of its train paths in advance, which provides enhanced cash flow visibility for HS1. \nAlthough there was some disruption from \nstrikes during the year, the HS1 management team worked closely with Network Rail High-Speed to ensure that a reduced Eurostar service was able to run on most strike days, largely mitigating the financial impact. On 20 March 2023, RMT members voted to accept a pay offer from Network Rail, which reduces the short-term risk of industrial action for HS1. \nThe HS1 management team and Eurostar \nare jointly committed to exploring solutions to border congestion in London and Paris, which is limiting the maximum daily number of international services. The EU\u2019s ETIAS scheme, which is expected to be implemented in 2024, may also result in increased passenger processing times. In this context, HICL \u2019s forecast continues to assume that international train path bookings will return to pre-Covid levels by March 2025.\nDomestic services are currently under UK \ngovernment control and HS1 continues to benefit from the contractual underpin from the Department for Transport, guaranteeing 96% of pre-Covid domestic track access revenues. Despite recent evidence that rail passenger demand has returned to pre-Covid levels in some market segments, DfT-controlled train operating companies are likely to resist increases in service levels in order to control costs. HICL \u2019s forecast therefore assumes that domestic train path bookings will remain at current levels (c.20% below pre-Covid) until March 2028, three years later than previously assumed.\nAs a result of the significant improvement in \ninternational train path bookings during the year, retail revenue outperformance, and the contractual inflation linkage built into all track access revenues, HS1 is expected to resume shareholder distributions during the 2023 calendar year. The business is well positioned to capture future growth as it leverages its role as the green gateway to Europe.\nSector:  Transport\nLocation:  UK\n% of portfolio: 4% (March 2022: 5%)\nHICL holding:  21.8%\nConcession life remaining:  18 years\nStatus:  Operational\nInvesting in \ninfrastructure:\n300kph\ntop speed of  \ntrains on HS1\nEnriching lives:\n100%\nrenewable electricity  \nused to power trainsthe UK\u2019s rail link with  \nContinental EuropeGreen\ngateway", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d90d6fe0-5edf-4bc3-bbc5-e3ac514dee05": {"__data__": {"id_": "d90d6fe0-5edf-4bc3-bbc5-e3ac514dee05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "44bbedc8-3fb3-418c-9cec-de6237bd6afb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "2f2966b29f8b4a20da0b4a182155c91b0a53497c90ce9b5ba99981357464a21d"}}, "hash": "2f2966b29f8b4a20da0b4a182155c91b0a53497c90ce9b5ba99981357464a21d", "text": "Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 202333\nHICL\u2019s investment covers over 50 buildings and five \ntraining facilities used by the Royal School of Military Engineering Group (\u201cRSME\u201d), which provides a wide range\u00a0of training to the British army and defence forces. \nOperationally, the project continued to perform well, with \navailability during the entire year of over 99.8%.

Southmead Hospital \nSouthmead Hospital is a major 800-bed acute \nhospital, providing accident and emergency and specialist medical services to a population of almost one million people in Bristol, South Gloucestershire, and North Somerset.\nDuring the period, InfraRed collaborated with the \nclient and other project stakeholders to progress an agreed programme of works relating to the contractual obligations of Carillion Plc, the original construction contractor for the hospital which was liquidated in 2018. Because the works require access to critical areas such as operating theatres, they are expected to be phased over several years. The complexity and scope of the works is reflected in the discount rate used to value the asset as at 31 March 2023. Shareholder distributions resumed in late 2021 and continued to be paid during the year.\nIn order to relieve pressures on the demand for patient \nbeds, the NHS Trust presented a request to turn administrative areas into clinical accommodation. Employing the flexible approach developed during the Covid-19 pandemic, InfraRed, the portfolio company and its subcontractor expedited the request through a bespoke variation process. As a result, the first phase of the project was completed ahead of schedule in early January 2023, providing additional beds at the height of the winter peak. The second and third phases of the project completed in April 2023, providing an additional 32 beds in total.\nOn behalf of the NHS Trust, Bouygues Energies & \nServices (who provide the facilities management services under the PPP) undertook a carbon reduction survey which has been shared with the portfolio company.

Pinderfields Hospital is a designated major trauma centre and is home to two specialist regional services in burns and spinal injuries for the north of England.\nDuring the year, InfraRed and other key stakeholders \nagreed the terms for a major programme of works which will take place over the next five years. These include ventilation upgrades as well as improvements to intensive care units and Haematology. The agreement of commercial terms enabled the resumption of shareholder distributions and de-risked the future cash flows from the project.\nOperationally, the project performed in line with \nexpectations despite a period of heightened pressure for the NHS over the winter months. Responsibility for lifecycle rests with the portfolio company, and HICL \u2019s valuation as at 31 March 2023 acknowledges the potential risk of short-term cost increases. The portfolio company\u2019s construction partner has made significant progress on a large temporary ward which will accommodate patients whilst components of the main hospital are being upgraded. This is scheduled to be completed in the summer of 2023. \nDuring the year, the Investment Manager provided \nfinancial support towards a bereavement suite for families suffering from stillbirths and miscarriages.

In the Company\u2019s Strategic Report, the Directors report the financial performance using the non-GAAP Investment Basis, which consolidates the results of the Company, HICL Infrastructure 2 S.a.r.l. and Infrastructure Investments LP, referred to as the \u201cGroup\u201d throughout the Financial Review. The reconciliation of the Investment Basis to the IFRS financial statements is shown on pages 44-45.\nThe Investment Basis provides additional information on the \nunderlying performance of the Group to that required by IFRS 10 and the Directors believe this provides additional transparency and improves understanding for readers of HICL \u2019s Annual Report. It allows readers to assess the underlying operating performance and gearing, including its capacity for investment. Total return, which is defined as total comprehensive income for the year, NAV, and EPS are the same under IFRS and the Investment Basis.\nThe Board and the Investment Manager manage HICL on an \nInvestment Basis, which is an APM and is reconciled on page 43. Accordingly, the following limited financial information is prepared under the Investment Basis.\nSummary income statement\nInvestment Basis \n\u00a3mFor the  \nyear ended \n31 March 2023For the  \nyear ended  \n31 March 2022\nDividend income 191.1 75.8\nInterest income 122.1 117.2\nFair value movement (94.2) 192.0\nRealised gain on the sale \nof\u00a0investments \u2013 4.8\nForeign exchange movement on\u00a0investments 39.4 7.4\nLoss on foreign exchange derivatives (13.1) (1.9)\nOther income 8.9 10.5\nTotal income 254.2 405.8\nExpenses and finance costs (55.7) (37.4)\nProfit before tax 198.5 368.4\nTax (0.1) 0.3\nTotal return 198.4 368.7\nEarnings per share 9.9 19.0Total income decreased by 37% to \u00a3254.2m (2022: \u00a3405.8m). The decrease is principally due to a reduction in the fair value movement recognised from \u00a3192.0m to \u00a3(94.2)m which was driven by the 0.6% increase (2022: 0.2% decline) in the discount rate to 7.2% (2022: 6.6%). This was partially offset by the positive impact of actual and forecast inflation on the investment valuations. Dividend income increased to \u00a3191.1m (2022: \u00a375.8m) primarily due to the receipt of an \u00a385.0m dividend from the sale of Queen Alexandra Hospital (\u201cQAH\u201d). Further detail on the valuation movements is given in the Valuation of the Portfolio section starting on page 46. \nThe hedging policy targets NAV per share volatility of no more than \n2% for a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates. During the year, the net impact of foreign exchange movements was a \u00a326.3m gain (2022: \u00a35.5m gain), which represents 0.8% of the closing NAV (2022: 0.2%).

Given the importance of the valuation of investments, the Board\u2019s Audit Committee has oversight of the Investment Manager\u2019s valuation process and challenges the Valuation Policy, process and application to individual investments on a bi-annual basis. A third party is also appointed to carry out an independent review of the Investment Manager\u2019s valuation. Despite the above, asset valuations for unquoted investments are inherently subjective, as they are based on assumptions which may not prove to be accurate. \nThe Group\u2019s investments are predominantly unquoted and are \ntherefore valued using a discounted cash flow analysis of the forecast investment cash flows from each project. The exception to this is the listed senior debt in the A13 Road project.\nA key judgement is the assessment of whether the Company meets \nthe definition of an investment entity. IFRS 10 requires the Group\u2019s intermediate holding companies to be presented at fair value, which reduces the transparency of the underlying investment performance. As a result, the Group presents limited financial information on a non-GAAP Investment Basis to ensure that the commentary in the Strategic Report remains fair, balanced and understandable.

The Group also had drawings by way of letter of credit on its LCF facility of \u20ac67.3m (31 March 2022: \u20ac67.3m). Consequently, the Group has the capacity to fund additional investments as and when further attractive opportunities arise as well as maintain sufficient working capital. \nOn 20 March 2023, the Group announced that it had renegotiated \nits RCF with Barclays, CIBC, ING, Lloyds, NAB, RBC, Royal Bank of Scotland International and SMBC, increasing it to \u00a3650m, with an expiry date of 30 June 2026 with an option to extend for two one-year periods to 30 June 2028.

This investment valuation is called the Directors\u2019 Valuation. The Directors\u2019 Valuation, which is an Alternative Performance Measure (\u201cAPM\u201d), comprises the valuation of the investment portfolio as well as the future investments committed to by the Group at the reporting period end.\nThe Directors\u2019 Valuation is the preferred valuation measure \nof the portfolio because it includes future commitments and, therefore, represents the Group\u2019s total value at risk at the balance sheet date. Further detail on the Group\u2019s APMs, including a reconciliation to the IFRS financial statements, is shown on page 44. The valuation methodology and policy are unchanged from previous reporting periods.\nThe valuation is carried out on a six-monthly basis as at 31 March and \n30 September each year. The Group\u2019s investments are predominantly unquoted and are therefore valued using a discounted cash flow analysis of the forecast investment cash flows from each project. The exception to this is the listed senior debt in the A13 Road project which is valued using the quoted market price of the bonds.\nThere is a secondary market for infrastructure investments and, \nwhere appropriate and publicly available, data points are considered. The Directors\u2019 Valuation is a sum-of-the-parts valuation, and no further adjustment is made to reflect the size, scarcity, and diversification of the overall portfolio. \nThe key external (macroeconomic and fiscal) factors affecting the \nforecast of each portfolio company\u2019s cash flows in local currency are inflation rates, interest rates, rates of GDP and applicable tax rates. The Investment Manager makes forecast assumptions for each of these external metrics, based on market data and economic forecasts. The Investment Manager exercises its judgement in assessing the expected future cash flows from each investment based on the detailed financial models produced by each portfolio company and adjusting where necessary to reflect the Group\u2019s economic assumptions as well as any specific operating assumptions.\nThe fair value for each investment is then derived from the \napplication of an appropriate market discount rate and year-end currency exchange rate. The discount rate takes into account risks associated with the financing of an investment such as investment risks (e.g. liquidity, currency risks, market appetite) and any risks to the investment\u2019s earnings (e.g. predictability and covenant of the revenues and service delivery challenges), all of which may be differentiated by the phase of the investment\u2019s life (e.g. in construction or in operation).\nMore information on the Valuation Policy can be found on page 158.The Directors\u2019 Valuation is the key component in determining HICL \u2019s \nNet Asset Value (\u201cNAV\u201d) and so the Directors receive and challenge an independent report and opinion on the Investment Manager\u2019s valuation from a third-party valuation expert.\nDirectors\u2019 Valuation at 31 March 2023\nThe Directors\u2019 Valuation of the portfolio at 31 March 2023 was \u00a33,772.8m, an increase of 13.9% (31 March 2022: \u00a33,311.0m). The Directors\u2019 Valuation includes \u00a3274.2m of outstanding equity commitments (31 March 2022: \u00a394.4m) in respect of three projects: the Blankenburg Connection (Netherlands), TNT (USA) and the B247 Road (Germany).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe451298-c9cb-4a0c-8883-950bf633f751": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe451298-c9cb-4a0c-8883-950bf633f751", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a775553a-2c4b-47dd-b86c-3da7fd70ab98", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "56c81a96f2fa71a682ff45987b3c64dd97c81d663d7d00a4a1859ad25f4a8d73"}, "2": {"node_id": "daf2e64d-769f-4482-b2a8-3e5619646858", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "3e6c23bc096860bfcbbac0e6f2a99f21a0e0996b32039f811474bb6c41827a19"}}, "hash": "65b7823aff85063b9cb80574092410a03b066a60d2bef020c46ba9f7edf3514d", "text": "A breakdown of the movement in the Directors\u2019 Valuation is shown in \nthe chart below.Valuation of the Portfolio\n1 \u2018Return\u2019 comprises the unwinding of the discount rate and project outperformance including actual inflation\n2 FX m\novement net of hedging is a gain of \u00a326.4m\n3 \u00a33\n,772.8m reconciles, on an Investment Basis, to \u00a33,498.6m investments at fair value through \u00a3274.2m of future commitments", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "792f14e9-7fe1-40d6-a529-c48fc602bac8": {"__data__": {"id_": "792f14e9-7fe1-40d6-a529-c48fc602bac8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "82181a8c-020d-47f4-afa0-fa8fea58cf2e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "d8de9b6e055bfd1087ab67904d88a493f6e201e22677e367cbadcf8fc3407358"}}, "hash": "d8de9b6e055bfd1087ab67904d88a493f6e201e22677e367cbadcf8fc3407358", "text": "Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 202347\nAcquisitions\nThe acquisitions in the year include XLT, Fortysouth and a final \npayment for RMG Roads. Also included within the \u00a3547.6m is a commitment to invest in TNT.\nDivestments\nThe divestments include the disposal of QAH (\u00a3107.5m)1 and \nreduction in commitment for Paris-Sud University (\u00a35.6m).\nRebased net valuation\nThe three valuations shown in the chart have been split between investments at fair value\n2 and future commitments. The percentage \nmovements have been calculated on the rebased valuation of \u00a33,236.5m to reflect the returns generated on the capital employed in the year.\nThe rebased portfolio delivered Income Statement revenue of 8.0% \nin the year (2022: 14.6%). The reduced 2023 income return when compared to 2022 was principally due to the increase in discount rates in 2023 for all jurisdictions.\nReturn from the portfolio\nThe return from the underlying portfolio of \u00a3331.2m (2022: \u00a3269.8m) represents a 10.2% (2022: 9.6%) increase in the rebased valuation, versus the discount rate, or expected annualised return, of 6.6% at the start of the year. The \u00a3125.8m / 3.9% of outperformance was principally generated from actual inflation (\u00a3136.4m), over and above the base case assumption. This was partially offset by defect remediation costs that were incurred on healthcare projects, commodity price and supply chain pressures affecting the lifecycle costs in the UK PPP sector and a slightly slower recovery in expected traffic volumes in some of the Company\u2019s demand assets.Inflation\nThe HICL portfolio is highly correlated to inflation and, in isolation, is well placed to benefit in a higher inflationary environment, especially in the UK and Eurozone. In the UK, RPI in the year ended 31 March 2023 was 13.5% (2022: 9.0%). Similar slightly milder conditions were experienced in France, where CPI was 5.7% (2022: 4.5%), USA, where CPI was 5.0% (2022: 8.5%). This higher inflation had a net positive impact on the portfolio, in particular the Company\u2019s regulated and demand assets such as Affinity Water, Northwest Parkway and HS1, whose revenues are more correlated to inflation than the Company\u2019s PPP portfolio.\nOver the year, the actual inflation rates were higher than the \nCompany\u2019s forecast assumptions for the year. HICL \u2019s portfolio is deliberately constructed to provide high inflation correlation. Inflation remained elevated throughout the year and is forecast to remain high throughout 2023. Therefore, the Company updated its forecast short-term inflation assumptions in all jurisdictions. The impact of the change in forecast short-term assumptions is included within the \u00a372.0m (2022: \u00a372.3m) recognised in the change in economic assumptions.\nDemand assets\nHICL has seven demand-based assets in the portfolio, representing 19% of the portfolio value at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: 22%). Five of these demand-based assets, namely HS1, the A63 Motorway (France), NWP (USA), RMG Roads and M1-A1, are sensitive to GDP and, as a result, their valuations were more significantly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Demand on the A63 and HS1 was slightly above the forecast set out at the start of 2022 with traffic on NWP slightly below the forecast expectation at March 2022. The forecast demand for HS1 is impacted by lower domestic growth in traffic, primarily because of the lower post-pandemic domestic commuting environment, however, this is largely offset by the likelihood of more international paths over the longer term.\nFor further information on these assets, refer to the Top 10 assets \u2013 \noperational highlights.\n1 Reconciles to \u00a3108.1m of cash received on page 121 of the financial statements through additional sub-debt interest accrued of \u00a30.6m which is included in the \u00a3331.2m of Return on the \nR\nebased Valuation\n2 On a\nn IFRS Basis", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "011c1c3a-d584-4a15-a1ce-62ae4a714dbb": {"__data__": {"id_": "011c1c3a-d584-4a15-a1ce-62ae4a714dbb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a4c329bf-db63-4eb6-8570-7c82d351a140", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "8297fc6f8e86b201dda35151298db48d752a1bc63d0fff6d841d5394dc5a4214"}}, "hash": "8297fc6f8e86b201dda35151298db48d752a1bc63d0fff6d841d5394dc5a4214", "text": "HICL  Annual Report 202348\nDiscount rates\nThe discount rate is determined based on the Investment Manager\u2019s \nknowledge of the market, which includes intelligence gained from bidding and disposal activities across the InfraRed platform, discussions with financial advisers knowledgeable of these markets and publicly available information on relevant transactions.\nAs highlighted in the Company\u2019s 2022 Interim Results, the volume of \ninfrastructure transactions moderated over the Northern Hemisphere summer period. It has remained at a reduced level for the remainder of the Company\u2019s financial year. As market participants continue to assess the impact of rising long-term government bond yields on asset prices, the Investment Manager has observed greater investor focus on asset quality, a wider range of bid pricing for assets, and evidence of differing views between buyers and sellers over asset pricing, which is contributing to the reduced level of transaction activity. The Investment Manager expects transaction activity to increase during 2023 as the pricing of long-term government bond yields continues to settle. \nThe limited availability of transaction data points places greater \nemphasis on a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach, based on long-term government bond yields and an appropriate risk premium. The risk premium takes into account risks and opportunities associated with the project earnings (e.g. predictability and covenant of the concession income and service delivery challenges), all of which may be differentiated by project phase, jurisdiction and market participants\u2019 appetite for these risks.\nAs a result, and consistent with the approach taken for the \nSeptember 2022 valuation, the Investment Manager has considered the level of equity risk premium implied by current yields when setting the discount rate. In the first half of the financial year, the average 20\u201330 year government bond yields in the UK increased from 1.8% at 31 March 2022 to 4.0% at September 2022 before a slight reduction in the second half of the year to 3.8% at 31 March 2023. Whilst the Investment Manager\u2019s view is that discount rates used to value investments do not rigidly follow bond yields, there is some correlation, particularly over the longer term and this has been reflected in the discount rates applied to UK assets. The UK weighted average discount rate has increased by 80 basis points to 7.3% (31 March 2022: 6.5%) and the risk premium is now 3.4% (31 March 2022: 4.7%).In North America and the Eurozone, increases in long-term government bond yields have also been observed, albeit to a lesser degree than those observed in the UK. Therefore, we have increased the discount rate in the Eurozone by 30 basis points and in North America by 30 basis points. As a result, the overall weighted average discount rate of the portfolio has increased by 60 basis points to 7.2%\u00a0(2022: 6.6%).\nIn the portfolio, there were two projects in construction at 31 March \n2023, both of which are located in the Eurozone (31 March 2022: three). An investment in a project under construction can offer a higher overall return (i.e., require a higher discount rate) compared to buying an investment in an operational project, but it does not usually yield during the construction period and there is the risk that delays in construction affect the investment value.\nChange in economic assumptions\nChanges in economic assumptions resulted in a positive impact of\u00a0\u00a372.0m. The increase was principally due to changes in forecast inflation assumptions in all jurisdictions, as well as various changes in\u00a0interest rate assumptions and other minor movements for tax rates\u00a0outlined in the assumptions on page 49.\nForex\nGBP weakened against the Euro and the USD in the period resulting\u00a0in a positive impact of \u00a339.5m pre-hedging.

The impact of a 0.5% change in the discount rate on the Directors\u2019 Valuation and the NAV per share is shown above. Despite the volatility in the year, a higher sensitivity is not considered appropriate as the mix of the portfolio means that the sensitivity is linear and it is possible to determine the impact if percentage changes are in multiples of this sensitivity.\nInflation rate sensitivity\nPPP projects in the portfolio have contractual income streams derived from public sector clients, which are rebased every year for inflation. For the demand-based assets, the concession agreement usually prescribes how user fees are set, which is generally reset annually for inflation. On Affinity Water, one of HICL \u2019s regulated assets, revenues are regulated by Ofwat in a five-yearly cycle with the pricing of water bills set with the aim of providing an agreed return for equity that is constant in real terms for the five-year period by reference to RPI currently and CPIH in the next regulatory period.\nThe chart shows that the Directors\u2019 Valuation and NAV per share \nare both positively correlated to inflation. The portfolio\u2019s inflation correlation at 31 March 2023 was 0.8x (31 March 2022: 0.8x) such that should inflation be 1% p.a. higher than the valuation assumption for all future periods the expected return from the portfolio would increase from 7.2% to 8.0%.\nThe portfolio valuation assumes UK inflation of 5% for the year ending \nMarch 2024, 2.75% per annum for both RPI and RPIx to March 2030 and 2.0% thereafter. The March 2023 forecasts for RPI out to December 2023 range from 3.1% to 10.7% from 35 independent forecasters as compiled by HM Treasury, with an average forecast of 5.5%.\nMore information can be found on the effect of inflation on page 25.\nGross Domestic Product (\u201cGDP\u201d) sensitivity\nAt 31 March 2023, the portfolio had five investments which are \nconsidered sensitive to GDP, comprising 18% of the portfolio value (21% at 31 March 2022), namely the A63, M1-A1 Road, RMG Roads, NWP and HS1. At times of higher economic activity there will be greater traffic volumes using these roads and railways, generating increased revenues for the projects compared to periods of lower economic activity and therefore we assess these as GDP sensitive investments.\nIf outturn GDP growth was 0.5% p.a. lower for all future periods than \nthose in the valuation assumptions set out on page 49, expected return from the portfolio (before Group expenses) would decrease 0.2% from 7.2% to 7.0% (31 March 2022: 6.4%).Interest rate sensitivity\nThe vast majority of HICL \u2019s portfolio company\u2019s interest costs are at fixed rates, either through fixed-rate bonds, bank debt which is hedged with an interest rate swap or linked to inflation through index-linked bonds. However, there are five investments \u2013 Affinity Water (UK), Northwest Parkway (USA), TNT (USA), XLT (UK) and Fortysouth (NZ) which have refinancing requirements, exposing these investments to interest rate risk. The average gearing of the assets is lower than the portfolio as a whole, at 45%. As set out on page 50, were interest rates to be 1.0% higher in all future valuation periods, the expected return from the portfolio would decrease by 0.1% as a result of higher financing costs, before accounting for the offsetting positive impact of higher interest rates on cash balances. \nIn the case of other investments, sensitivity to interest rates \npredominantly relates to the cash deposits which the portfolio company is required to maintain as part of its senior debt funding. For example, most PPP projects would have a debt service reserve account in which six months of debt service payments are held.\nAt 31 March 2023, cash deposits for the portfolio were earning \ninterest at a rate of 3.0% per annum on average (31 March 2022: 0.2%).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87e819e4-fd0b-4059-a84a-9454da421ccc": {"__data__": {"id_": "87e819e4-fd0b-4059-a84a-9454da421ccc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d9ffdf3c-26d7-4e4b-a661-fa311a630ac1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "08071c026190b7ff293262e067683a6582fe2f3020cc8ca489d8b77c349c6094"}, "2": {"node_id": "37716b73-3c29-411e-94e7-1006aa747152", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "f79e4ed6c77e1cf75b98206b45cbfdf32758ff6f26ccfcba46c42740a04e4af8"}}, "hash": "01c26a2c9a7550150af87b99820257d4cccec877385459225567a015caefc635", "text": "Lifecycle expenditure sensitivity\nLifecycle (also called asset renewal or major maintenance) concerns the replacement of material parts of the asset to maintain it over the concession life.

The Board monitors, challenges and evaluates InfraRed\u2019s management of risk through the consideration of scenarios that could materially impact the performance of HICL were they to occur. Having considered and analysed key risks, mitigating action may be undertaken to reduce the likelihood and impact of each risk manifesting.\nThe Board has ultimate responsibility for setting HICL \u2019s risk policy and \nrisk appetite. It has convened a Risk Committee to assist the Board by assessing HICL \u2019s overall risk profile, recommending a risk appetite, and ensuring its framework is appropriately designed and effective. The terms of reference for the Risk Committee can be found on HICL \u2019s website.\nDay-to-day monitoring, evaluation and management of risk \nis undertaken by InfraRed as HICL \u2019s Investment Manager. Working closely with portfolio company management teams, InfraRed\u2019s Asset Management team ensures the timely reporting of\u00a0project-specific risks to the HICL Fund Management team as and when they arise; the HICL Investment Committee also undertakes a formal review of project-specific risks on a quarterly basis. The Investment Manager is monitored and challenged by the Risk Committee, which reports to the Board.The Investment Manager uses its experience, insight from investments within the Group\u2019s portfolio and the wider infrastructure market to consider future risks and develop appropriate mitigation strategies. The Investment Manager oversees the deployment of these strategies and directs portfolio company management teams as required. Relevant systems, policies, oversight and third-party assurance are utilised to ensure effective risk management.\nThe Board\u2019s Management Engagement Committee reviews the \nperformance of the Investment Manager (as well as all key service providers) at least annually and this review includes a consideration of the Investment Manager\u2019s internal controls and their effectiveness. No issues were identified in the latest review.

These are \nset out in the table below along with the Investment Manager\u2019s assessment of:\n\u2013\n The\n potential financial impact of plausible 12-month downside \nscenarios, which are developed by the Investment Manager and \nreviewed by the Risk Committee. They represent the estimated impact of severe but plausible scenarios, meaning they are not worst-case. Each scenario is presented before (inherent) and after (residual) the effect of mitigation strategies is considered; and\n\u2013\n A re\nsidual risk rating1 based on the likelihood and mitigated impact \nof the prudent downside scenario for each risk class.\nIf any one of the plausible 12-month downside scenarios described above were to materialise, the NAV / share impact would be impacted immediately, but the effect on cash flow may extend beyond the current year, with a consequential impact on dividend cash cover. The Risk Committee has therefore decided to focus on the five-year cash flow impact of each scenario.\nThe Investment Manager regularly presents stress scenarios and \nassociated mitigation strategies to the Risk Committee to assist its assessment of more severe but lower-probability downside scenarios. \nThere has been no change to the residual risk ratings of the seven \nprimary risk classes over the year. Although the residual risk from portfolio performance is still considered to be high, the Investment Manager continues to make progress in delivering defect remediation works, with a number of key milestones achieved across the portfolio. The risk posed to HICL \u2019s demand-based assets by Covid-19 significantly reduced during the year as asset usage increased, although some uncertainty remains around the potential impacts of long-term behavioural change. InfraRed successfully mitigated the risk of adverse behaviour from public sector clients through collaborative and active engagement, although there remains a risk that persistent high inflation places heightened financial pressure on public sector counterparties. Supply chain disruption, increased energy costs and materials inflation had a limited impact on a subset of projects during the period, with the wider risk to HICL mitigated by contractual pass-through mechanisms. The residual risk rating for both the financial / market risk and political risk classes continues to be assessed as medium. For financial / market risk, rising base interest rates across HICL \u2019s jurisdictions in response to high inflation led to increased financial market volatility in the year, but the valuation impact of rising discount rates was largely offset by the portfolio\u2019s high correlation to inflation. Political and regulatory risk is an inherent feature of the infrastructure asset class which can evolve at relatively short notice, evidenced by the changes to the UK government during the year. The Company\u2019s primary mitigation is through its diverse portfolio, which is exposed to a wide range of different clients, sectors, regulatory regimes and geographies.\nPrincipal risks\nThe tables on the following pages summarise the principal risks which are regularly reviewed by the Risk Committee and have the potential to reduce the Company\u2019s ability to achieve its strategic objectives and materially impact HICL \u2019s financial performance and reputation. They are not an exhaustive list of risks and uncertainties faced by the Group. Further information on the principal risks and uncertainties facing HICL can be found in HICL \u2019s March 2019 Prospectus which is\u00a0available on the Company\u2019s website at www.hicl.com. \nThe Directors have carried out a robust assessment of the \nCompany\u2019s emerging and principal risks. The movement in risk status for each principal risk, when compared with the previous financial year, is set out in the tables below. The Investment Manager\u2019s Report (starting on page 20) provides additional commentary on how the risk landscape faced by the Company has evolved during the year.\nThe risks posed by climate change, whilst not expected to be material \nto the Company, are an integral part of the Investment Manager\u2019s risk management framework. Further information on the assessment and management of climate-related risks can be found in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, starting on page 67.", "start_char_idx": null,

202362\nRisk Committee Report\nThe following pages set out the Risk \nCommittee\u2019s report on its activities for the year ended 31 March 2023. The Risk Committee operates within clearly defined terms of reference, which are available on the Company\u2019s website. The Risk Committee is comprised of all Directors and meets four times a year, coinciding with the quarterly Board meetings, and is available to convene ad hoc should material matters arise.\nIn discharging its responsibilities, the duties of the Risk \nCommittee\u00a0comprise defining the risk appetite of the Group, assessing, monitoring and managing the principal risks to which the\u00a0Group is exposed, as well as establishing and overseeing mitigating action. In particular, we consider risk exposure and controls, stress and scenario planning, regulatory compliance, portfolio company controls\u00a0and the three lines of defence.\nSimon Holden\nRisk Committee Chair\n23 May 2023Main duties and general approach\nThe Risk Committee\u2019s main duties are, as set out in its terms of \nreference, to consider and where necessary make recommendations to the Board, on the following:\n\u2013\n the\n Company\u2019s implementation of an effective governance \nstructure and control framework which covers key risk areas with \nappropriate reporting;\n\u2013 th\ne Group\u2019s risk appetite statement (reviewed annually at a \nminimum), taking account of the current economic, political, and business environment, as well as any short-term shocks or longer-term trends (such as climate change) which might affect portfolio performance; \n\u2013\n ri\nsk limits and tolerances, and risk management; \n\u2013 ongoi\nng regulatory compliance;\n\u2013 th\ne Group\u2019s risk profile, challenging the assessment and \nmeasurement of key risks whilst monitoring the actions taken  \nto manage and mitigate them;\n\u2013 sc\nenario analysis to determine whether proposed mitigation is \nsufficient to manage the business risk profile within the Board\u2019s appetite; and \n\u2013\n th\ne Investment Manager\u2019s advice on material changes to \ninvestment strategy, the treasury policy, the hedging policy  \nand the risk policy.\nStatement of the Chair  \nof the Risk\u00a0Committee\nThe Company has a risk management framework covering all aspects of the Group\u2019s business. The Company is an Alternative Investment Fund (\u201cAIF\u201d) and the Investment Manager (as Alternative Investment Fund Manager, (\u201cAIFM\u201d)) is responsible for risk management and has well-established systems and controls to manage and monitor risk. The Board places reliance on the Investment Manager\u2019s systems and controls and through its Risk Committee, monitors, reviews and challenges their effectiveness.\nThe risk management framework operates across a range of \ntimeframes and likelihoods, from; i) previously identified risks with mitigating actions already underway, ii) the identification of near-term emerging risks, including potential catalysts of \u2018black swan\u2019 events, and iii) longer-term \u2018horizon risks\u2019 that might influence HICL \u2019s portfolio and investment policy in the decades ahead.\nThe risk management framework follows a cascade approach, \nwith three \u2018lines of defence\u2019, to effectively safeguard and protect the interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Investment Manager implements mitigation strategies, which are regularly reported to and assessed by the Risk Committee:\n\u2013\n Th\ne first line is the development of systems to implement effective \ncontrols. These are set out in documents such as the Company\u2019s \nand the Investment Manager\u2019s Policies and Controls Manuals. The Company must generally be satisfied that the Investment Manager\u2019s systems and processes ensure that risk is effectively anticipated, controlled, reported and overseen. InfraRed, as the Company\u2019s Investment Manager and the Operator of HICL \u2019s portfolio, is responsible for the identification, classification, assessment and management of risk both within the existing portfolio and in evaluating new investment opportunities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5ab208c-4200-4e95-bdf7-96f9c03623f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5ab208c-4200-4e95-bdf7-96f9c03623f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f4a51569-5709-4e7c-a23d-a1e9388b4608", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "a7b3accd50546183d6986806c76d88737526043210cd948577fc4e85a4ce38eb"}, "3": {"node_id": "bde93e0d-a2e9-4726-ad60-f148c487bb2b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "91f1b1e9c97be94f58b5a8c554d0002b291b2ffca9bee18052b9b48f26807f59"}}, "hash": "e31333a3c7e910009ba1a6ca9340260432d5be69cb6174e300e3d125563a4748", "text": "Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 202363\n\u2013 The second line is that of oversight and engagement from the Risk \nC\nommittee, who scrutinise and challenge InfraRed\u2019s approach to \nrisk management. At each quarterly meeting, the Risk Committee conducts an in-depth review of the most material risks faced by the Group, which are assessed quantitatively (based on potential valuation and cash flow impact) and qualitatively (reputational impacts). The Committee also considers longer-term factors to which the Company may need to adapt in the future (\u2018horizon risks\u2019) such as climate change, as well as risks which may impact the future delivery of the Company\u2019s investment proposition, including \u2018black swan\u2019 risks. Mitigation strategies are proposed by the Investment Manager, with progress being monitored by the Risk Committee. The Risk Committee also ensures that all relevant policies are up to date and that delegated authorities are observed.\n\u2013\n Th\ne third line is third-party assurance which is used on an as-\nneeded basis to provide independent scrutiny of the Company\u2019s risk management framework, an audit of key controls and specialist guidance. The results are reported to each of the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee as appropriate.\nRoutine business\nThe Committee considered and noted compliance with HICL \u2019s Investment Policy and other policies relating to gearing, hedging and risk reportable events, which are fundamental to the Company\u2019s risk appetite.\nWithin the Investment Policy, the Risk Committee has established \nApproved Investment Parameters (\u201cAIPs\u201d). These are designated thresholds that are approved by the Board in coordination with the Investment Manager. These set the perimeter of HICL \u2019s risk appetite as it relates to portfolio construction, fund level gearing and hedging. The AIPs have served as intended during year, with compliance monitored by the Risk Committee and any proposed investment which would exceed the limits set by the AIPs appropriately considered in advance. AIPs are adjusted from time to time based on the evolution of the Company\u2019s investment strategy and operating environment; during the year a thorough review was undertaken as set out in more detail in the following section.\nThe Committee\u2019s routine quarterly agenda covers, inter alia, a \nsummary of key risks faced by the Group (including changes to the potential impact or timing of known risks as well as a consideration of emerging and longer-term \u2018horizon\u2019 risks, with climate and environmental risks notable amongst these), a review of HICL \u2019s risk management policies and updates on relevant fund or portfolio company matters as required.\nThe Committee received quarterly reporting from the Investment \nManager in relation to health and safety matters. The safe working practices of our contractors and the avoidance of injuries are always of paramount concern and are closely monitored across the portfolio at all times.\nThe Committee considered, at each meeting, regulatory compliance \nreports from both the Investment Manager and Aztec, the Company\u2019s Administrator and Secretary. The Committee also received compliance reports from the Depositary. No significant action points or notable comments arose in respect of these regular reviews.\nThe Committee concluded each quarterly meeting with an \nassessment of whether HICL was compliant with its stated risk appetite and, confirmed that, taken as a whole, this was the case. The Committee also concludes by ensuring the Investment Manager\u2019s attention focuses on any areas the Chair wishes to see closer scrutiny of and reporting against in subsequent quarters.Process and reporting updates\nOver the course of the year, the Investment Manager continued to refine its risk management process and its quarterly reporting to the Risk Committee in a number of areas: \nStress testing and scenario analysis\nA rolling programme of stress testing and scenario analysis for HICL was presented to the Risk Committee at each of its meetings throughout the year. The Investment Manager continued to refine the scenarios included within each Primary Risk Class based on the Company\u2019s evolving portfolio and operating environment. As a result of the volatile macroeconomic backdrop in the second half of the year, the Investment Manager presented several new stress tests covering the Financial/Market and Political primary risk classes. \nRefreshed AIP framework\nDuring the year, the Investment Manager worked closely with the Risk Committee to undertake a thorough review and refresh of the Company\u2019s AIP framework.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bde93e0d-a2e9-4726-ad60-f148c487bb2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "bde93e0d-a2e9-4726-ad60-f148c487bb2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f4a51569-5709-4e7c-a23d-a1e9388b4608", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "a7b3accd50546183d6986806c76d88737526043210cd948577fc4e85a4ce38eb"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5ab208c-4200-4e95-bdf7-96f9c03623f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "e31333a3c7e910009ba1a6ca9340260432d5be69cb6174e300e3d125563a4748"}}, "hash": "91f1b1e9c97be94f58b5a8c554d0002b291b2ffca9bee18052b9b48f26807f59", "text": "The main objectives were to ensure that the Company is not overly exposed to any material risk across its portfolio of assets, whilst providing an appropriate level of delegated authority to the Investment Manager given its market expertise. Each parameter within the framework reflects a distinct risk inherent within HICL \u2019s evolving portfolio of modern core infrastructure assets, and the concentration limits are set with the aim of providing adequate oversight for a company of HICL \u2019s size and capital structure. The revised framework, which was ratified by the Risk Committee in February 2023, also clarifies the categorisation of risks and is expected to enhance the Risk Committee\u2019s ability to appropriately evaluate new investment opportunities.\nKey Risk Indicators\nIn November 2022, the Investment Manager presented a refreshed set of Key Risk Indicators (\u201cKRIs\u201d), which are an important part of its risk management framework and are reported on a quarterly basis to the Risk Committee. The updated KRIs reflect the evolving nature of the risks faced by the Company and are designed to be leading indicators of potential changes to HICL \u2019s residual risk position. Previously, there were 44 KRIs across the seven primary risk classes, and subsequent to this review, nine new KRIs were approved, five were adjusted and five removed as no longer considered appropriate.\n\u2018Black swan\u2019 risks\nDuring the year, the Risk Committee considered potential \u2018Black swan\u2019 risks, which are by definition unlikely to occur but could arise with limited warning and have a potentially significant impact on the Company. This included an assessment of the potential impact of each risk, the degree to which each risk is systemic or Company specific, as well as the degree of control that the Company or Investment Manager has in monitoring, preventing or mitigating the impact of these risks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ada0a117-7a77-4443-a639-86b031532377": {"__data__": {"id_": "ada0a117-7a77-4443-a639-86b031532377", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "562fe233-a6e3-4ec0-839f-90628708cc02", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "febbf94b2a5220097a23de18fb3c4092cdf5d0f572cb5b346b54b25fd922b6ee"}, "3": {"node_id": "2b632d24-9fc7-483f-81af-3fde05a2b70a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "df8ddccdd8c9e519931ae72f1773762ca74f7b63de5ab716f056472ff5bf053d"}}, "hash": "96853671641e1a9b82884e2abf67e0738df710fd761a92228a96844ac9b35968", "text": "HICL  Annual Report 202364\nViability Statement \nThe AIC Code of Corporate Governance (the \u201cAIC Code\u201d) requires \nthe Directors to make a statement regarding the Company\u2019s viability in the Annual Report, explaining how they have assessed the Company\u2019s prospects, the period of time for which they have made the assessment and why they consider that period to be appropriate.\nThe Directors have determined that the five-year period to March \n2028 remains an appropriate period over which to assess HICL \u2019s viability as:\n\u2013\n Th\nis period aligns with the Company\u2019s business planning exercises, \nincluding how the Directors assess the Company at their annual \nstrategy Board meeting;\n\u2013 It i\ns the period over which the internal stress testing is performed; \nand\n\u2013 Alt\nhough the long-term and/or contractual nature of our \ninvestments means that the Directors have a higher level of confidence over the endurance and longevity of the Group, it is challenging to assess the regulatory, tax and political environment outside of the five-year period with any certainty.\nAssessment of HICL\u2019s prospects\nThe Directors\u2019 primary assessment of the Company\u2019s prospects is achieved through the annual strategic and business planning exercise. The Directors review a five-year budget and business plan, which is prepared by the Investment Manager and includes cash flow projections to aid strategic planning and provide support for the dividend approval process. The projections consider cash balances, investment commitments, key covenants and limits, dividend cover, investment policy compliance and other key financial indicators over that five-year period. These projections are based on the Investment Manager\u2019s expectations of future asset performance, income and costs and are consistent with the methodology applied to provide the\u00a0valuation of investments.\nHICL \u2019s portfolio consists of companies whose underlying assets \nare predominantly fully constructed and operating PPPs or similar projects with public sector counterparties in jurisdictions with established and proven legal systems. As a result, the Company benefits from predictable long-term contracted cash flows and a set of risks that can be identified and assessed (see Risk & Risk Management on page 53). The projects are each financed on a non-recourse basis to the Company and are supported by detailed financial models. The Directors believe that the non-recourse financing and diversification within the investment portfolio helps to withstand and mitigate the risks it is most likely to meet. In addition, the Company has a low level of operating expenses relative to forecast receipts from its portfolio investments, with the largest cost being the management fee. The Company funds its investments using equity and longer-term debt and its gearing is well within its Board approved investment parameters in the five-year period and the Company can withstand a material increase in interest costs.\nThe Company has not been immune to recent increased market \nvolatility and its shares have traded at a discount to NAV for a sustained period. Notwithstanding this current discount, the Company has successfully demonstrated its ability to support its near-term investment pipeline with the renegotiation of its \u00a3650m revolving credit facility, \u00a3150m Private Placement issue as well as its active capital recycling programme which provides a valuable source of funding beyond capital markets and evidence of the robustness of HICL \u2019s investment portfolio valuation. Since IPO, HICL has sold on average one asset a year.Assessment of viability\nIn making this statement, the Directors have considered the resilience of the Company, considering both its current position and its principal risks, in severe but plausible downside scenarios, and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions.

HICL will seek to acquire Infrastructure Equity with similar risk / reward characteristics to the current portfolio, which may include (but is not limited to):\n\u2013\n Publ\nic sector, government-backed or regulated revenues;\n\u2013 Con\ncessions which are predominantly \u2018availability\u2019 based  \n(i.e. the payments from the concession do not generally depend  \non the level of use of the project asset); and / or\n\u2013 Comp\nanies in the regulated utilities sector.\nHICL will also seek to enhance returns for shareholders by acquiring \nmore diverse infrastructure investments. The Directors currently intend that HICL may invest in aggregate up to 35% of its total assets (at the time the relevant investment is made) in:\n\u2013\n Pr\noject companies which have not yet completed the construction \nphases of their concessions but where prospective yield \ncharacteristics and associated risks are deemed appropriate to the investment objectives of HICL. This may include investment in companies which are in the process of bidding for concessions, to the extent that such companies form part of a more mature portfolio of investments which HICL considers appropriate to acquire;\n\u2013\n Pr\noject companies with \u2018demand-based\u2019 concessions where \nthe Investment Manager considers that demand and stability of revenues are not yet established, and / or project companies which do not have public sector sponsored / awarded or government-backed concessions; and\n\u2013\n To a l\nesser extent (but counting towards the same aggregate \n35% limit, and again at the time the relevant investment is made) in limited partnerships, other funds that make infrastructure investments and / or financial instruments and securities issued by companies that make infrastructure investments, or whose activities are similar or comparable.Geographic focus\nThe Directors believe that attractive opportunities for HICL to enhance returns for investors are likely to arise outside as well as within the UK (where the majority of the projects in the current portfolio are based). HICL may therefore make investments in the European Union, Norway, Switzerland, the Americas and selected territories in Asia and Australasia. HICL may also make investments in other markets should suitable opportunities arise. HICL will seek to mitigate country risk by concentrating on investment opportunities in jurisdictions where it considers that contract structures and enforceability are reliable and where (to the extent applicable) public sector obligations carry what the Investment Manager believes to be a satisfactory credit rating and where financial markets are relatively mature.\nSingle investment limit and diversity \nof\u00a0clients and suppliers\nFor each new acquisition made, HICL will ensure that such \ninvestment acquired does not have an acquisition value (or, if it is a further stake in an existing investment, the combined value of both the existing stake and the further stake acquired is not) greater than 20% of the total gross assets of HICL immediately post acquisition.\nThe total gross assets will be calculated based on the last published \ngross investment valuation of the portfolio plus acquisitions made since the date of such valuation at their cost of acquisition.\nThe purpose of this limit is to ensure the portfolio has a number of \ninvestments and is not dominated by any single investment.\nIn selecting new investments to acquire, the Investment Manager will \nseek to ensure that the portfolio of investments has a range of public sector clients and supply chain contractors, in order to avoid over-reliance on either a single client or a single contractor.\nRestrictions under the Listing Rules\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority, HICL has adopted the policies set out below:\n\u2013\n HI\nCL \u2019s primary objective is investing and managing its assets \nwith a view to spreading or otherwise managing investment risk. \nHICL must, at all times, invest and manage its assets in a way which is in accordance with its Investment Policy;\n\u2013\n HI\nCL will not conduct a trading activity which is significant in the \ncontext of HICL as a whole.

Leverage is considered in terms of HICL \u2019s overall exposure to financial or synthetic gearing and includes any method by which its exposure is increased whether through borrowing of cash or securities, foreign currency holdings, leverage embedded in derivative positions or by any other means. It is expressed as the ratio between the total exposure of HICL and its net asset value such that if its exposure was equal to its net asset value, leverage would be disclosed as 100%; a value above 100% means that HICL has leverage equal to the percentage amount above 100%. Exposure values are calculated by two methods, gross and commitment, as defined within the AIFMD. Exposure under the gross method represents the aggregate of all HICL \u2019s exposures other than cash balances held in base currency; the commitment method takes into account the effect of different treatment of certain cash and cash equivalent items and of offsetting instruments between eligible assets to reflect netting and hedging arrangements in line with\u00a0regulatory requirements.\nMaximum leverage levels have been set by the Board and InfraRed \nand are in accordance with the maximum borrowing allowed by HICL \u2019s Articles of Association.\nThe table below sets out the current maxima, and permitted limit and \nactual level of leverage for HICL as a percentage of its net asset value as at 31 March 2023.\nLeverageGross \nMethodCommitment \nMethod\nMaximum limit 150% 150%\nActual level 123% 107%\nMike Bane\nChair\n23 May 2023Strategic Report Disclosures continued", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0dc414c0-6d72-436f-b121-b086e50ad861": {"__data__": {"id_": "0dc414c0-6d72-436f-b121-b086e50ad861", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5227d79b-ede2-4774-8889-411c9e4a6bc1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "c684421f3491254f9fd44a1bb130360ae32238f7ee16646258a10257c40f897c"}}, "hash": "c684421f3491254f9fd44a1bb130360ae32238f7ee16646258a10257c40f897c", "text": "Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 202367\nIntroduction \nOver recent years, it has become even \nmore evident that climate change has the potential to negatively impact infrastructure assets around the world. For infrastructure stakeholders, frequent extreme weather events and rising sea levels are increasingly visible consequences of manmade greenhouse gas emissions. The Board and Investment Manager strongly believe that making a proactive and positive contribution to climate action is in the best interests of HICL \u2019s shareholders, clients and wider\u00a0stakeholders.\nOn behalf of HICL, InfraRed actively identifies and works to mitigate \nthe risks that climate change poses to the Company whilst also looking to reduce the actual and potential adverse impacts of business decisions on societies and the environment. The disclosures below provide key climate-related information, and cross-references to where additional information can be found (either within this report, or within HICL \u2019s 2023 Sustainability Report, published on the HICL website on the same day as this report).\nHICL began voluntarily reporting against a subset of the 11 TCFD \ndisclosure recommendations in its 2020 Annual Report and Financial Statements and has reported against all 11 recommendations since 2021. We confirm that we have complied with the requirements of LR 9.8.6R, by including climate-related financial disclosures that are consistent with the four TCFD pillars and the 11 recommended disclosures that are set out on page 72. We also acknowledge that there is always scope for improvement, and that there are certain areas where the Company is in the process of gathering and publishing more data.Governance\nFor HICL to act in a sustainable manner, it is critical that its Board, Investment Manager and portfolio companies are accountable for their actions. HICL \u2019s robust and ambitious corporate governance framework helps to ensure this is delivered and provides investors with transparency on the Company\u2019s sustainability strategy and the wider impact environmental and societal impact of their investment, including in relation to climate change.\nThe Board has overall responsibility for the oversight of HICL \u2019s \nsustainability risks and opportunities, of which climate change is an important subset. The Board and the Investment Manager meet on a quarterly basis, during which they review the risks facing the Company, including risks related to climate change.\nSustainability is also a key topic at the Board\u2019s annual \nstrategy meetings.\nSome of the Board\u2019s Committees also have key roles:\n\u2013\n Th\ne Risk Committee oversees and challenges InfraRed\u2019s risk \nmanagement processes and analysis, and has a specific remit to \nexamine \u2018horizon\u2019 risks such as the long-term consequences of climate change;\n\u2013\n The\n Management Engagement Committee considers how \nHICL service providers, including InfraRed, adhere to HICL \u2019s Sustainability Policy;\n\u2013\n The\n Audit Committee reviews the Company\u2019s approach to \ndisclosures, including those relating to climate change.\nIn relation to climate-related opportunities, the Investment Manager presents a review of the market to the Board on a quarterly basis. As part of this review, potential new acquisition opportunities are highlighted, including those which directly support the transition to\u00a0a\u00a0low-carbon economy.\nAlthough management of the portfolio, as well as investment \ndecisions within agreed parameters, is delegated to InfraRed as the Investment Manager, the Board has overall responsibility for the\u00a0Company\u2019s investment policy.\nFurther information on HICL \u2019s corporate governance framework is \nprovided on page 74 of this report.

The results of the portfolio-wide assessment are still considered to be valid for the current financial year.\nThe Investment Manager has identified that in the short term, based \non current climate conditions, a subset of assets in which HICL has invested are exposed to acute and chronic physical risks arising from different extreme weather events, but the overall exposure is limited, and mitigations are in place. The Company may also be exposed to transition risks if there are rapid, unexpected changes to government policy, which are more likely under the 1.5\u00b0C scenario as set out below. In general, the portfolio-level findings of the climate change impact assessment demonstrate that the Company\u2019s strategy is highly resilient to both physical and transition risks associated with climate change.\nThe schematic below sets out the process undertaken to identify and \nanalyse climate-related risks under a range of scenarios.

In many cases physical mitigation measures already exist and there is a degree of contractual protection from increased costs to implement further measures. Such risks are likely to be exacerbated under a 4\u00b0C scenario, whereas under a 1.5\u00b0C scenario assets are more likely  \nto be impacted by transition risks.\nUnder a \u2018current\u2019 climate scenario, only eight assets have an \nunmitigated physical impact index above 3.0 (medium) This rises to 19 assets under a 4\u00b0C scenario, demonstrating the resilience of the portfolio even in the event of extreme climate change.\nBeyond 2040, based on a 4\u00b0C scenario, there is slightly increased \nexposure to physical risks. Under a 1.5\u00b0C scenario the impact of transition risks could be greater, but many assets have inherent protection as they provide vital services and have low direct emissions. Conversely, there is likely to be greater scope to take advantage of opportunities arising from the energy transition,  \nsuch as asset repurposing and additional investment.\nHICL \u2019s main physical risk exposures based on both current and \nfuture conditions are to winter storms, river flooding and coastal flooding, which is expected based on the weighting of the portfolio towards Northern Europe. Geographical location is also an inherent mitigant against other physical risks such as drought and heat stress. Although some assets have very high exposure to flooding, significant physical mitigation already exists in the form of flood defences, particularly in low-lying countries such as the Netherlands. The potential annual loss across the portfolio from windstorms and flooding is not expected to be material, with mitigation measures further reducing any impact in \u2018severe\u2019 years. HICL \u2019s assets benefit from comprehensive insurance policies, which include physical damage as a result of climate-related events.Transition risks analysis:\nExamples of transition risks under a 1.5\u00b0C scenario include increased public transport use, a reduction in overall journeys and car sharing, which could impact some of HICL \u2019s demand-based assets. Such a scenario is also likely to present a number of opportunities for the Company at both the asset and market level.\nA transition to a low-carbon economy also presents a number of \nopportunities. The primary example is the need for related investment such as rapid charging or retrofitting of energy efficiency solutions. A key tenet of HICL \u2019s vision is to support sustainable modern economies by investing in assets linked to the energy transition, and a 1.5\u00b0C scenario is likely to increase the number of investable opportunities in this space. \nDuring the year, a review of insurance costs was undertaken across \nthe portfolio. As is common with real assets, insurance is one of the primary risk mitigants against the financial impact of physical damage. In the future, and particularly under a 4\u00b0C scenario, it is possible that the cost of obtaining insurance increases as a result of the increased likelihood of severe weather events, although this is likely to be limited to a small number of assets. The impact of climate change risks on future insurance premia is factored into the assumptions used in the valuation of each of HICL \u2019s assets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4079d210-16b5-44cb-948b-665b07509df3": {"__data__": {"id_": "4079d210-16b5-44cb-948b-665b07509df3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dccc0732-5613-4950-91e1-1234834a40d5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "e786f2af28d4d2584a10e27864bf9b7cbedb3416b6d715a55982662b4f41b378"}, "2": {"node_id": "10d37ebf-5d4f-4ed4-8211-7669df28641b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "299cda5e0a2391598b50394cbce8b1a3841e3108f0b04bc89a38ba426db4c8ef"}}, "hash": "1c33b09e6f681ab19a1a2d34019143b5dde98187ea0657836f4dbbf60d70945f", "text": "TCFD Category Climate-related trend Potential financial impact Potential materiality\nPhysical Flooding Risk:  damage to physical structures resulting in unavailability / increased cost 4\u00b0C \u2013 low 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 low \nPhysical Winter Storm Risk:  damage to physical structures resulting in unavailability / increased cost 4\u00b0C \u2013 low 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 low\nPhysical Drought Risk:  Usage restrictions or increased costs at Affinity Water\nOpportunity:  Increased long-term investment required at Affinity Water4\u00b0C \u2013 med1.5\u00b0C \u2013 low\nTransition Retrofitting of energy efficiency solutionsOpportunity:  variation contracts awarded for existing PPP assets 4\u00b0C \u2013 low 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 low\nTransition Increased public  \ntransport useRisk:  Lower traffic using toll roads\nOpportunity:  greater usage of HS14\u00b0C \u2013 low 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 med\nTransition Move towards electric vehicles & trainsOpportunity:  Co-located EV charging at HICL \u2019s toll road projects\nOpportunity:  Long-term use case for XLT4\u00b0C \u2013 low 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 low\nTransition Increased need for renewable energyOpportunity: Long-term use case for OFTOs 4\u00b0C \u2013 low 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 low\nTransition Remote working Risk:  reduced traffic volumes using demand-based transport assets\nOpportunity:  greater take-up and adoption of technology benefiting \ncommunications assets4\u00b0C \u2013 low 1.5\u00b0C \u2013 medSummary of material risks and opportunities:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c7986d6-22f5-47a0-98d8-e9145e800df0": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c7986d6-22f5-47a0-98d8-e9145e800df0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0e1f8cea-49ad-423a-b5e6-6b38f73b81cf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "db655e95bc17194f9a620ef04e65882bb3ad656313376389c898fa11f22a738c"}}, "hash": "db655e95bc17194f9a620ef04e65882bb3ad656313376389c898fa11f22a738c", "text": "HICL  Annual Report 202370\nHow we identify and assess climate risk \nFor new acquisitions, climate-related risks are considered throughout \nthe investment process by the Investment Manager. At the deal screening phase, the identification of climate-related risks (physical or transition) and the potential impact (positive or negative) are mandatory requirements. Furthermore, the completion of a climate change risk assessment prior to entering into a transaction is now a\u00a0formal condition of approval.\nFor existing projects, risks have been identified and assessed through \na detailed climate change impact assessment, as set out in the section above. The Company\u2019s portfolio companies use the results of this assessment to undertake proactive monitoring and assessment at the project level.\nOver the year, InfraRed\u2019s Asset Management team engaged with the \nmanagement teams of HICL \u2019s portfolio companies. Using the climate change impact assessment, the vast majority of HICL \u2019s portfolio companies have adopted the findings by discussing climate-related risks and opportunities at board level, updating risk matrices, and developing and implementing mitigation and resilience strategies as appropriate.\nHow we manage our risks \nInfraRed\u2019s Asset Management team ensures the timely reporting of project-specific risks relating to climate change to the HICL Fund Management team as and when they arise; the HICL Investment Committee also undertakes a formal review of all project-specific risks\u00a0on a quarterly basis. This process ensures that material  \nclimate-related risks feed into the Investment Manager\u2019s quarterly reporting to the Risk Committee, which in turn reports to the Board.\nThe Company\u2019s positioning with respect to a transition to \na low-carbon economy is primarily considered through the Investment Manager\u2019s active approach to asset management and\u00a0portfolio construction.\nHICL \u2019s core infrastructure investments provide essential services to \ncommunities, and as a result are inherently well positioned. For HICL \u2019s PPP projects, energy use is driven by the client, with the portfolio company generally responsible for maintaining the equipment which provides the building\u2019s heating, cooling and lighting. Any changes to these systems required under a 1.5\u00b0C scenario would usually be accounted for under existing lifecycle budgets or alternatively treated as a contract variation. HICL \u2019s GDP-correlated demand-based assets such as toll roads, which may be exposed to transition risks and opportunities under a 1.5\u00b0C scenario, benefit from strong strategic positioning. The Company also invests directly in assets which are likely to benefit from a low-carbon transition, such as OFTOs.More broadly, InfraRed\u2019s exclusion policy specifically covers carbon-intensive industries such as coal, oil and gas (where not aligned to a low-carbon transition) and HICL does not invest in assets whose primary purpose is electricity generation.\nSustainability considerations are incorporated into the Investment \nManager\u2019s risk management framework, which is used as the basis of risk reporting to the HICL Risk Committee. In particular, sustainability features as a material risk in the following risk classes:\n\u2013\n Pol\nitical risk: in particular, policies associated with the transition to \nnet zero carbon emissions;\n\u2013 Op\nerational risk \u2013 execution: through transaction due diligence and \ninvestment decisions; and\n\u2013 Por\ntfolio performance risk: sustainability risks can affect operational \nperformance, including transitional and physical risks associated \nwith adverse climate change.\nClimate change risk is an explicit building block of portfolio performance risk. Individual project companies submit regular progress reports to InfraRed on the mitigation measures they are taking in response to the climate change impact assessment. In turn, this enables the HICL Risk Committee to consider the overall impact and opportunities of climate change at fund level.\nFurther details are provided in the Risk & Risk Management section, \nstarting on page 53 of this report.Risk management", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97a24c8b-6d41-44a3-b4c8-8c62cbd096cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "97a24c8b-6d41-44a3-b4c8-8c62cbd096cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9f7ac01e-b2c6-431b-88c6-333000052f13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "3d74f38959234be2350c4c361a287277b049e2b73350b0b039878683f5b3a210"}}, "hash": "3d74f38959234be2350c4c361a287277b049e2b73350b0b039878683f5b3a210", "text": "Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 202371\nMetrics and targets\nOther metrics and targets\nOur specific climate and environment-related metrics and targets, as set out in this report have been made considering the TCFD \nrecommendations and are set out below:\nMETRIC Current year Previous year% PORTFOLIO  \nREPORTING PAI?

The Board has put in place a framework for corporate governance which it believes is appropriate for an investment company. All Directors contribute to the Board discussions and debates. The Board believes in providing as much transparency for investors and other stakeholders as is reasonably possible within the boundaries of client and commercial confidentiality.\nAIFM Directive\nThe Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive seeks to regulate AIFMs and imposes obligations on Managers who manage alternative investment funds (\u201cAIF\u201d) in the EU or who market shares in such funds to EU investors. HICL is categorised as an externally managed AIF for the purposes of the AIFM Directive. In order to maintain compliance with the AIFM Directive, HICL complies with various organisational, operational and transparency obligations, including the pre-investment disclosure information required by Article 23 of the AIFM Directive.\nNon-mainstream pooled investments\nHICL conducts its affairs as an investment trust. On this basis, the Ordinary Shares should qualify as an \u201cexcluded security\u201d and therefore be excluded from the FCA\u2019s restrictions in COBS 4.12 of the FCA Handbook that apply to non-mainstream pooled investment products.The AIC Code of Corporate Governance\nAs a member of the AIC, the Board has considered the Principles and Provisions of the 2019 AIC Code of Corporate Governance (the \u201cAIC Code\u201d), a framework of best practice in respect of the governance of investment companies. The 2019 AIC Code applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.\nThe AIC Code addresses the Principles and Provisions set out in the \nUK Corporate Governance Code (the UK Code), as well as setting out additional Provisions on issues that are of specific relevance to investment companies. The Board considers that reporting against the Principles and Provisions of the AIC Code, which has been endorsed by the Financial Reporting Council, provides more relevant information to shareholders. HICL has complied with the Principles and Provisions of the AIC Code.\nThe AIC Code is available on the AIC website (www.theaic.co. uk\n1). \nIt includes an explanation of how the AIC Code adapts the Principles \nand Provisions set out in the UK Code to make them relevant for investment companies.\nBoard\nAs at 31 March 2023, the Board comprised eight non-executive Directors. In accordance with Provision 10 of the AIC Code all of the non-executives who served during the year are independent of the Investment Manager. The Chair, Mike Bane, met the independence criteria of the AIC Code Provision 11 upon appointment and has continued to meet this condition throughout his term of service. Although not a requirement of the AIC Code, in accordance with guidance in Provision 11, the Board has a Senior Independent Director, Frank Nelson. Frank met the independence criteria of the AIC Code Provision 11 upon appointment and has continued to meet this condition throughout his term of service. Being non-executive Directors, none of the Directors have a service contract with\u00a0the Company.\nThe Articles of Incorporation provide that each of the Directors \nshall retire at each Annual

Board papers include:\n\u2013\n a re\nview of the infrastructure market detailing key developments;\n\u2013 in\nvestment activity in the period and the pipeline of potential new \ninvestment opportunities;\n\u2013 a re\nview of portfolio performance in the period with material issues \nidentified and discussed;\n\u2013 a r\neview of any sustainability issues and Company sustainability \ninitiatives from the period;\n\u2013 a re\nview of any health and safety matters in the period;\n\u2013 a d\netailed financial review, including detailed management \naccounts, valuation and treasury matters; and\n\u2013 re\nports from HICL \u2019s brokers and from the financial PR company.\nMatters relating to the Company\u2019s risk management and internal \ncontrol systems (including associated stress tests), are considered by the Risk Committee (which, in turn, reports any significant matters / findings to the Board) and these are set out in more detail in the Risk Committee Report on page 62.\nThe Board regularly requests further information on topics of interest \nto allow informed decisions to be taken.\nOn a semi-annual basis, the Board, through the Audit Committee, \nalso considers the Interim and Annual Reports as well as the detailed valuation of the investment portfolio prepared by the Investment Manager and the third-party expert opinion on the proposed valuation. On at least an annual basis, the Board considers a detailed analysis of HICL \u2019s Budget and Business Plan for the coming year.\nPerformance evaluation\nIn 2021 an external review was commissioned as part  \nof the triennial independent Board performance review.In the year to 31 March 2023 the Board conducted its own internal evaluation, considering the performance, tenure and independence of each Director. This annual self-evaluation was undertaken using a questionnaire, and also by way of one-to-one interviews by the Chair with each Director holding office in the year. The Chair presented a summary of the conclusions to the Board. Feedback on the Chair was collated by the Senior Independent Director who then briefed the Chair.\nThe independence of each Director has been considered and each \nhas been confirmed as being independent of the Company and its Managers. The Board believes that the composition of the Board and its Committees reflects a suitable mix of skills and experience, and that the Board, as a whole, and its Committees functioned effectively during the last 12 months and since the launch of the Company.\nDelegation of responsibilities\nThe Board has delegated the day-to-day administration of the Company to Aztec Financial Services (UK) Limited in its capacity as\u00a0Company Secretary and Administrator.\nHICL delegates the majority of the day-to-day activities required to \ndeliver the business model, including responsibility for the majority of\u00a0HICL \u2019s risk and portfolio management, to the Investment Manager, InfraRed, subject to the overall oversight and supervision of the Directors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4cc2d492-d4bf-410b-9563-be03645c41e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4cc2d492-d4bf-410b-9563-be03645c41e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bae58a43-90a4-44ef-bb99-34d5aa19d6a9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "8c3d5132e7da5ac824561f8b7599395d83d6b17e209cee89699bb56f9ea9497e"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b70816a-2107-418f-87ba-86d8bba33830", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "5ab652f5f84a09ff5450e101d3a2230e8007a7eb41215d2a419a24f96df1de9b"}}, "hash": "48cd50ab943c0d73b2d173bd10a338feed95bcf1ac868237bff96b3f31b12297", "text": "InfraRed also operates and manages the Partnership and its assets in accordance with and subject to the Investment Policy, investment guidelines and approved investment parameters that are adopted by the Directors from time to time in conjunction with (and with the agreement of) InfraRed.\nThe strategies and policies which govern the delegated activities \nhave been set by the Board in accordance with section 172 of the Companies Act 2016.\nConflict of interest\nAs at 31 March 2023, the Board comprised eight non-executive Directors, all of whom are independent of the Investment Manager.

In order to deal with these potential conflicts of interest, detailed procedures and arrangements have been established to manage transactions between HICL, InfraRed or funds managed by InfraRed (the \u201cRules of Engagement\u201d).

To help achieve this end, the Board has a designated Risk Committee. It follows a process designed to meet the particular needs of HICL in managing the risks to which it is exposed.\nAt each Board meeting, the Board also monitors HICL \u2019s investment \nperformance in comparison to its stated objectives and it reviews HICL \u2019s activities since the last Board meeting to ensure adherence to approved investment guidelines. The pipeline of new potential opportunities is considered and the prices paid for new or incremental investments during the quarter are also reviewed.\nThe Investment Manager prepares management accounts and \nupdates business forecasts on a quarterly basis, which allow the Board to assess HICL \u2019s activities and review its performance.\nThe Board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function and \nit has decided that the systems and procedures employed by the Investment Manager and the Secretary, including their own internal review processes, and the work carried out by HICL \u2019s external auditors, provide sufficient assurance that a sound system of internal control, which safeguards HICL \u2019s assets, is maintained. An internal audit function specific to HICL is therefore considered unnecessary albeit, from time to time, independent assurance assignments may be\u00a0commissioned by the Board.\nThe Board recognises that these control systems can only be \ndesigned to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss, and rely on the operating controls established by both the Company Administrator and the Investment Manager.\nThe Audit Committee also plays a vital role in overseeing internal \ncontrols. For more information please see the Audit Committee Report starting on page 83.\nThe Board and the Investment Manager have agreed clearly defined \ninvestment criteria, return targets, risk appetite and exposure limits.

The Committee reviewed a paper prepared by InfraRed, which detailed how it had taken due account of the matters raised and the enhancements it proposed to relevant disclosures in the Interim accounts and 2023 Annual Report and accounts. \nThe Company\u2019s internal control and risk management systems, \nincluding those in relation to the financial reporting process include: \n\u2013\n an o\nverview of the Investment Manager\u2019s system of key control \nand oversight processes, line manager reviews and systems\u2019 \naccess controls; \n\u2013 upd\nates for the Committee on accounting developments, including \ndraft and new accounting standards and legislation; \n\u2013 ap\nproval of the Company\u2019s budget in February 2023 by the \nBoard and a comprehensive system of financial reporting to the Board, based on the annual budget with quarterly reporting of actual results, analysis of variances, scrutiny of key performance indicators and regular re-forecasting; \n\u2013\n re\nports from the Investment Manager on matters relevant to the \nfinancial reporting process, including quarterly assessments of internal controls, processes and fraud risk; \n\u2013\n in\ndependent updates and reports from the external auditor on \naccounting developments, application of accounting standards, key accounting judgements and observations on systems and controls, where appropriate; \n\u2013\n an o\nverview of the Investment Manager\u2019s appointment of \nexperienced and professional staff, both by recruitment and promotion, of the necessary calibre to fulfil their allotted responsibilities as part of the Management Engagement Committee in February 2023; and \n\u2013\n appr\nopriate Board oversight of external reporting.I am pleased to present the Audit Committee \nreport for the year ended 31 March 2023. My report outlines the work performed by the Committee in the year. Subsequent to the 2022 AGM, I replaced Sally-Ann Farnon as Chair of the Audit Committee who retired from the Board in July 2022, after nine years of service to the Company.\nWe held regular scheduled meetings during the year, four \nof which were aligned with the Company\u2019s reporting cycle. Member attendance can be found on page 79. Other regular attendees at these meetings included: the Company Chair, members of the Investment Manager including the CFO, and the external auditor, KPMG LLP (\u201cKPMG\u201d). In accordance with the Committee\u2019s role in the investment valuations, separate meetings were held to review and challenge the Investment Manager\u2019s valuation assumptions, judgements and resulting valuations of the Company\u2019s underlying portfolio of infrastructure assets.

See Note 12 to the IFRS financial statements.\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s investment is based on the Net \nAsset Value of IILP and the sundry assets and liabilities of the direct Corporate Subsidiary. IILP\u2019s Net Asset Value is based on the fair value of the underlying investments in its portfolio of infrastructure assets.\nOther than the A13 Senior Secured Bonds (which are listed and \ntherefore valued based on the quoted market price), market quotations are not available for the Company\u2019s underlying investments, so their valuation is undertaken using a discounted cash flow methodology. This methodology requires a series of material judgements to be made as further explained in the Valuation of the Portfolio starting on page 46 of this report.The Audit Committee discussed the valuation process and methodology with the Investment Manager in September, October, November and December 2022 as part of its review of the September 2022 Interim Report and early NAV release in October 2022, the December NAV update as well as in March, April and May 2023 as part of its review of the March 2023 Annual Report.\nThe Investment Manager carries out valuations semi-annually and \nprovides detailed valuation reports to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also receives a half-year and year-end valuation report and opinion from a third-party valuation expert. An additional valuation was performed off cycle for 31 December 2022 which followed the same approach. The Audit Committee considered and challenged the valuation assumptions, with particular focus on inflation, judgements, and methodology.\nThe Audit Committee met with KPMG six times during the year. \nIn November 2022, the Audit Committee reviewed and agreed KPMG\u2019s initial audit plan, while in February and April 2023 the Audit Committee discussed the audit approach as well as in May 2023 following the conclusion of the audit.\nKPMG explained the results of their audit and confirmed that the results \nof KPMG\u2019s audit testing were satisfactory.\nValuation of investments \u2013 key forecast assumptions\nThe key forecast assumptions are future inflation rates, interest rates, rates of gross domestic product and tax rates. These assumptions are explained in further detail in the Valuation of the Portfolio starting on page 46 of this report.The Audit Committee considered in detail and provided robust challenge to the economic assumptions that are subject to judgement and that may have a material impact on the valuation. In addition, the Audit Committee considered the impact (both actual and potential) of geopolitical issues on these key economic assumptions as well as on the investments\u2019 underlying cash flows, in particular for those investments with demand risk.\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the Investment Manager\u2019s valuation \nreports, in conjunction with a report and opinion on the valuation from  \na third-party valuation expert.\nThe Investment Manager confirmed to the Audit Committee that \nthe economic assumptions were consistent with those used for acquisitions, and the third-party valuation expert confirmed that the economic assumptions were within an acceptable range.\nDue to the current levels of inflation, the Audit Committee paid particular \nfocus to the assumptions applied to short-term inflation assumptions. The third-party valuation expert confirmed that the inflation assumptions were within an acceptable range.\nThe Investment Manager provided sensitivities showing the impact of \nchanging these assumptions, which have been considered by the Audit Committee and the external auditor.\nThe external auditor challenged, with support of their internal valuation \nspecialist, discount rates and macroeconomic assumptions applied in the valuation by benchmarking these to independent market data, including recent market transactions, and using their specialist\u2019s experience in valuing similar investments. They further assessed the reasonableness of the Company\u2019s assumptions by comparing these to the assumptions used by comparator companies, sales processes, back-testing of disposals and other third-party information.\nThe Audit Committee concluded that the Investment Manager\u2019s \nvaluation process was robust, that a consistent valuation methodology had been applied throughout the year and that the key forecast assumptions applied were appropriate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ab63d66-d6ac-43bf-b2f3-9cb330b153cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ab63d66-d6ac-43bf-b2f3-9cb330b153cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "93137dbe-8009-419a-b6b0-89b5bc49d13a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "db4b3e4dfb6e9e1e8bddf483272d0ba19354f9cc6f097cebf0b27d7ef7bf5a2f"}}, "hash": "db4b3e4dfb6e9e1e8bddf483272d0ba19354f9cc6f097cebf0b27d7ef7bf5a2f", "text": "HICL  Annual Report 202386\nSignificant issue considered Audit Committee actions and conclusions\nValuation of investments \u2013 discount rates\nThe discount rates used to determine the valuation are selected and \nrecommended by the Investment Manager. The discount rate is applied to the expected future cash flows from each investment\u2019s financial forecasts to arrive at a valuation (discounted cash flow valuation). The resulting valuation is therefore sensitive to the discount rate selected.\nThe Investment Manager is experienced in valuing these investments and \nadopts discount rates reflecting their current and extensive experience of the market. The Investment Manager sets out the discount rate assumptions and the sensitivity of the valuation of the investments to this discount rate in the Valuation of the Portfolio starting on page 50.The Audit Committee challenged the Investment Manager on their material judgements and compared this to feedback from the third-party valuation expert.\nThe Investment Manager highlighted to the Audit Committee the \nforecast impact on cash flows of several stress scenarios alongside its assessment of the risk to these cash flows.\nThe Investment Manager presented analysis of the risk-free rate \nmovement and implied risk premium when determining discount rates.\nThe Audit Committee was satisfied that the range of discount rates was \nappropriate for the valuation carried out by the Investment Manager.\nGoing concern and Viability statement\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, with the assessment period of five years unchanged in the Viability statement. See Note 2 for details.The Investment Manager provided a paper explaining the rationale for the going concern basis of preparation, which has been considered by the Audit Committee and the external auditor.\nThe Audit Committee met with the Investment Manager to discuss the \nrationale and challenge key assumptions applied, as part of its review  \nof the Annual Report.\nThe Audit Committee also reviewed the Company\u2019s Viability statement \nand accompanying commentary, as well as projections and sensitivities prepared by the Investment Manager to support the statement.\nThe Audit Committee concluded that the Investment Manager\u2019s \njudgement applied to the going concern basis of preparation and the Company\u2019s Viability statement was appropriate.\nAlternative Performance Measures (\u201cAPMs\u201d)\nThere are various APMs used throughout the Annual Report to give investors more information. One of these is the Investment Basis which is included to aid users of the Annual Report to assess the Company\u2019s underlying operating performance and its gearing as well as providing additional transparency into HICL \u2019s Statement of Financial Position, including its capacity for investment and ability to make distributions. Total return, NAV, and EPS are the same under IFRS and the Investment Basis. The Board and the Investment Manager manage the Company on an Investment Basis.The Audit Committee reviewed the Investment Manager\u2019s assessment of the Investment Basis including its presentation by challenging the disclosures made in the Annual Report and whether due attention was given to the distinction between the Investment Basis and IFRS.\nOther APMs and their relevance to investors were challenged by the \nAudit Committee in order that the Annual Report provides meaningful disclosure to investors. The Annual Report includes a subsection in the Financial Review on pages 43 that details the assessment of APMs.\nFair, balanced and understandable\nThe 2019 AIC Code of Corporate Governance requires the Board to present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Company\u2019s position and prospects.\nAs noted above, the Company prepares pro forma summary \nfinancial information under the Investment Basis, as well as reporting in accordance with IFRS in order to report the relevant financial performance and position to stakeholders.The Audit Committee reviewed the March 2023 Annual Report to ensure that, when taken as a whole, it presents a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Company\u2019s position and prospects.\nThe Audit Committee received a draft version of the March 2023 Annual \nReport for its review and comment, as well as a specific paper from the Investment Manager to aid its assessment of the March 2023 Annual Report being fair, balanced and understandable.\nAs such, the Audit Committee was able to provide positive confirmation \nto the Board, for it to fulfil its obligations under the AIC Code of Corporate Governance.Audit Committee Report continued", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5dc0da56-103f-42d3-8243-b5d3ae0723a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "5dc0da56-103f-42d3-8243-b5d3ae0723a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9c80db5f-3f25-4617-a12a-dc4814d13610", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "9f56dcaafe238c238430aeb001be7df474b11fbf7362d8e739de6897c522f04e"}}, "hash": "57d24dd2c1dbe15615408c699c273bd7da093bca3d6e2716d3c3ad1b09a41543", "text": "Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 202387\nAccounting policies and practices\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the appropriateness of, and was \nsatisfied with, the Company\u2019s accounting policies.\nThe Directors exercised judgement in determining whether the \nCompany and the Corporate Subsidiaries meet the IFRS 10 definition of an investment entity. By virtue of the Company and Corporate Subsidiaries\u2019 status as investment entities, all investments (including the Corporate Subsidiaries) are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. Further detail is contained within Note 2 of the financial statements.\nInternal controls\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the Company\u2019s statement on internal controls in relation to accounting records, the valuation process and accounts preparation, prior to endorsement by the Board.\nThe Management Engagement Committee reviews the adequacy \nand effectiveness of the Investment Manager\u2019s internal controls as part of its annual review of the Investment Manager\u2019s performance. In addition, the Board reviews and debates a quarterly self-assessment internal control report prepared by the Investment Manager \u2013 see the Risk & Risk Management section of this report starting on page 53 for further detail. In the year, the Committee also received an paper on the Investment Manager\u2019s internal controls.\nInternal audit\nIn line with FRC guidance, the Audit Committee keeps under review the need for an internal audit function. This was last considered in November 2022 as part of the CFO\u2019s update on finance controls. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the systems of internal control of the Company, the Investment Manager and the Administrator are adequate to fulfil the Board \u2019s obligation in this regard and that currently an internal audit function is not necessary. Additionally, HICL \u2019s Depositary provides cash flow monitoring, asset ownership verification and oversight services to the Company. The Committee considers the need for discrete internal audit engagements as appropriate. External auditor\nThe Audit Committee notes the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code and in particular the requirement to put the external audit out to tender at least every ten years. The external audit was most recently tendered in 2015 for the financial year ended 31 March 2016. As reported in the 31 March 2015 Annual Report, KPMG was reappointed as auditor at the completion of the last tender process.\nThe Audit Committee continues to monitor developments on \n\u201cRestoring trust in audit and corporate governance\u201d originally published by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. They remain supportive of the stated aims to strengthen the UK\u2019s framework for major companies and the way in which they are audited.\nThe Company is in compliance with the requirements of The Statutory \nAudit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the frequency and governance of tenders for the appointment of the external auditor and\u00a0the setting of a policy on the provision of non-audit services. \nAuditor independence\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing KPMG\u2019s independence and performance. It establishes policies for the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor and reviews the terms under which the external auditor may be appointed to perform non-audit services, and the scope and results of the audit, including KPMG\u2019s effectiveness.

When recruiting new Directors, the Board searches for candidates from a diverse range of backgrounds and communities to attract the widest breadth of talent, skills and outlook. The Board\u2019s policy is to appoint individuals on merit, based on their skills, experience and expertise.\nHICL has achieved the key targets of the Hampton-Alexander Review \nand the Parker Review, that 33% of the Board of Directors should be women by the end of 2020 and at least one Director is from an ethnic minority by 2024. As at 31 March 2023, 37% (three) of the Board of Directors were women and 13% (one) was from an ethnic minority.\nThe FCA\u2019s Listing Rules require a listed company to disclose in its \nannual report whether it has met its diversity target of at least one senior position on its board of directors (i.e. Chair, Chief Executive, Senior Independent Director or Chief Financial Officer) being held by a woman. Furthermore, the Listing Rules recognise that such a disclosure requirement might not be appropriate in the context of Chapter 15 closed-ended investment companies, the boards of which are typically comprised wholly of non-executive directors. However, the HICL Board believes it important that this target should be substantively met, and accordingly would highlight that both the Chair of the Audit Committee and the Investment Manager\u2019s CFO, who is responsible for managing the financial activities carried out by the Investment Manager for the Company, are female.\nHICL has no employees beyond its non-executive Board. \nThe executive management of HICL is provided by its Investment Manager, InfraRed, with the senior decision-making body being InfraRed\u2019s Investment Committee. InfraRed is a global business  \nwith a broad cultural representation of employees reflecting the international nature of its activities. \nInfraRed supports equal opportunities regardless of age, race, gender \nor personal beliefs and preferences, both in their recruitment and when managing existing employees. InfraRed prioritises workforce engagement and implements a range of initiatives to enhance employee wellbeing, including fitness and mental health schemes, mentorship programmes, promotion of charity work and organising social activities. HR systems are in place to allow employees to raise any concerns in confidence. InfraRed recognises that when its employees are engaged, it will benefit from elevated productivity and increased employee loyalty.\nThe data shown in the table below reflects the gender and ethnic \nbackground of the Investment Committee and Company Secretary, and was collected on the basis of self-reporting by the individuals concerned.

HICL continues to meet the criteria to qualify for Payment Practice Reporting. This requires HICL Infrastructure PLC to report on its payment policies and specific data on payments and suppliers that demonstrate achieved performance every six months. For the purpose of this reporting HICL Infrastructure PLC is required to state a standard payment term. As HICL Infrastructure PLC does not have standard payment terms defined, the standard payment period in line with government guidance is the contractual payment period most commonly used in the period; this has been deemed to be 30 days.\nGreenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reporting\nSee page 71 \u2013 Metrics and targets.\nPolitical contributions\nHICL made no political donations during the year (2022: none).\nGoing concern\nThe Company\u2019s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in HICL \u2019s Business Model on page 14. The financial position of the Company, its cash flow and liquidity position are described in the Investment Manager\u2019s Report on page 20 and the Financial Review on page 40. In addition, the Notes of the financial statements include the Company\u2019s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.The Directors have assessed going concern by considering areas of financial risk, the Company\u2019s access to credit facilities and by reviewing cash flow forecasts with a number of stress scenarios. They also considered the Company\u2019s considerable financial resources, including investments in a significant number of project assets and access to credit facilities (details of which are set out in the Financial Review on page 40 and Note 15 to the financial statements). The majority of these project assets operate long-term contracts with various public sector customers and suppliers across a range of infrastructure projects. The financing for these projects is non-recourse to the Company.\nBased on this analysis, the Directors have concluded that the \nCompany has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, a period of at least 12 months from the date of approving these financial statements. Thus, they consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements. \nShare repurchases \nNo shares have been bought back in the year. The latest authority to purchase shares for cancellation was granted to the Directors on 20 July 2022. \nSustainability\nThe Board is committed to sustainability leadership in the sector. To minimise the environmental impact of HICL \u2019s corporate affairs, all reporting to the Board and its various Committees is paperless. In addition, the Investment Manager has offset all emissions associated with Directors\u2019 travel with an accredited scheme and will continue to do so going forward. For more information, see page 36 for the Sustainability Highlights.\nTreasury shares\nSection 724 of the UK 2006 Companies Act allows companies to hold shares acquired by market purchase as treasury shares, rather than having to cancel them. Issued shares may be held in treasury and may be subsequently cancelled or sold for cash in the market. This gives HICL the ability to reissue shares quickly and cost efficiently, thereby improving liquidity and providing HICL with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84f68097-477c-4784-880a-627d67f5c8bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "84f68097-477c-4784-880a-627d67f5c8bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c809398c-ec72-4710-97bf-eaac623eb3a4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "3f39e9ea049da9e03e603d1aca6679ca701bbd581065786ced927db7a2d2060f"}, "2": {"node_id": "7295428f-66da-4c93-afb4-c2f29aca1c67", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "2710fc1b8465ac1acba15db2e38bcb889d79f6e4ce42480d328885f4a39c62e9"}}, "hash": "f6f61cea7f8af26479536e8282eafccc5fa246b4c69edaccf6bd4528a240b509", "text": "While there are currently no shares held in treasury, the Board would \nonly authorise the resale of such shares from treasury at prices at or above the prevailing net asset value per share (plus costs of the relevant sale).

The report includes the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Policy, an explanation of the Committee\u2019s structure and responsibilities, a report on its activities in the year ended 31 March 2023 and relevant required reporting on remuneration and shareholdings. \nThis report is prepared in accordance with the Listing Rules of the \nFCA, the relevant sections of the Companies Act 2006 and the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, (as amended by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Amendment Regulations 2013, the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 and the Companies (Directors\u2019 Remuneration Policy and Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report) Regulations 2019). Those aspects of the report that are required to be audited are labelled as such.\nThe Committee met twice during the year. There have been \nno changes to the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Policy or the terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee. After careful consideration, the Committee recommended to the Board that the Chair and Directors\u2019 fees are increased to include a 5% inflationary uplift, in order to continue to attract and retain Directors with an appropriate skillset and experience for the Company, but are not increased to the full level of current inflation.\nThis Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report was adopted by the Board and \nsigned on its behalf by:\nFrances Davies \nRemuneration Committee Chair\n23 May 2023Directors\u2019 Remuneration Policy\nThe Directors\u2019 Remuneration Policy is determined by the \nRemuneration Committee. In accordance with the provisions of the AIC Code of Corporate Governance (the \u201cAIC Code\u201d), Directors\u2019 remuneration is designed to reflect their duties and time commitments. Remuneration is set at a reasonable level to attract and retain Directors of the necessary quality and experience to execute effective governance and oversight of the Company, to support strategy and to promote long-term sustainable success. The specific additional responsibilities of the Chair, Senior Independent Director, and the Chairs of the various Committees of the Board are taken into account. The policy aims to be fair and reasonable compared to equivalent investment trusts, investment companies and other similar-sized financial companies. The effects of inflation are also considered. Reasonable travel and associated expenses are reimbursed. \nHICL \u2019s Articles of Association limit the aggregate fees payable to \nthe Board to a total of \u00a3700,000 p.a. (or such amount as HICL \u2019s shareholders, in a general meeting, shall determine from time-to-time) excluding reimbursable expenses. Within that limit it is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee, as a Committee of the Board, to determine Directors\u2019 remuneration in conjunction with the Chair of the Board, and in his case, by the Remuneration Committee only. Relevant comparative information is considered in forming these recommendations and the views expressed by shareholders are taken into consideration. The Remuneration Committee will seek the views of an independent external remuneration consultant at least every three years to assist its review of remuneration. This was last performed in 2020 with an out-of-cycle review performed in 2021. As a result of the additional review, the next triennial review is scheduled to be performed in late 2023.\nDirectors\u2019 fees are fixed and are payable in cash.

Overview of our audit \nFactors driving our\u00a0view of risks We considered the developments affecting the Company since the last audit for the year ended 31 March 2022 and have updated our risk assessment.\nContinued geopolitical tension and global macroeconomic \ndownturn were the dominant themes for the year ended 31 March 2023. In early 2022, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine intensified geopolitical tensions which continued during 2023. In addition, energy costs rocketed in 2022, combined with the food supply chain disruptions, inflation remained high in major economies throughout 2022 and 2023. This required central banks to adopt a series of monetary policy measures, primarily through increases in interest rates, to seek to contain inflation. \nThese factors, along with the market volatility in the UK \nprimarily caused by political uncertainties since September, contributed to challenging market conditions for the investment industry. \nThis means the level of judgement required to be exercised \nby the Company in the valuation of investment entity subsidiaries, which is primarily driven by the valuation of the underlying infrastructure, PFI and PPP projects, continued to be a focus area. \nAs part of our risk assessment, we have maintained our \nfocus on the valuation of the investment entity subsidiaries, which is primarily driven by the valuation of the underlying infrastructure, PFI and PPP projects. We have designed our audit procedures accordingly. This has included specific focus on the discount rate used in the valuation model, macroeconomic assumptions (such as inflation, GDP growth and interest rates), and project specific cash flows\u00a0and adjustments made by the Company.Key Audit Matter Vs FY22 Item \nValuation of investment held at fair value through profit or loss \n4.1\n Similar risk to FY2022", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a66de94-2653-4939-b40b-2ad35a13af1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a66de94-2653-4939-b40b-2ad35a13af1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7ccd7d29-594c-41cb-a2a3-f2b93977253a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "d6c0119be1c3ea2e6425c46d80caaefb2a4be712843a48260ec431c0ad2a8639"}}, "hash": "d6c0119be1c3ea2e6425c46d80caaefb2a4be712843a48260ec431c0ad2a8639", "text": "Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 202399\nAudit committee \ninteraction During the year, the Audit Committee met nine times.

We consider total assets to be more in line with industry practice and as these are directly driven by the investment valuations which ultimately is most influential to the users of\u00a0the financial statements. A change in benchmark does not materially impact the materiality as the total liabilities of the Company are not material. Apart from this change, the increase in audit materiality reflects an increase in Company\u2019s total asset value, driven by the increase in investment valuations. \nWe determined that Total assets is the materiality \nbenchmark. As such, we based our materiality on total assets, of which it represents 1.0% (FY22: 1.0% of net assets).Materiality levels used in our audit\nMateriality\nPM\nAMPT\u00a333.6m\u00a330m\n\u00a322.5m\n\u00a325.2m2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\n2023\u00a31.5m\n\u00a31.6m\nPM: Performance Materiality\nAMPT:  Audit Misstatement Posting Threshold \nThe impact of \nclimate change on\u00a0our audit We have considered the potential impacts of climate change on the financial statements as part of planning our audit. This included the impacts on the infrastructure, PPP and PFI projects held indirectly by the Company through its investment entity subsidiaries. \nAs part of our audit we have made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact of \nclimate change risk on the Company\u2019s financial statements. We have performed a risk assessment of how the impact of climate change may affect the financial statements and our audit. Taking into account the nature of the Company\u2019s underlying investments, our assessment is that the climate related risks to the Company\u2019s business strategy and financial planning did not have a significant impact on our audit, including our key audit matters.\nWe have also read the Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) in the front half of the annual \nreport and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec8f8593-299f-454e-ad7a-20adc7909fe9": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec8f8593-299f-454e-ad7a-20adc7909fe9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "515c5692-02de-4ff4-8259-755d0b0ae9ee", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "102", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "ef047bb201eaea7ee28038a1bf5c323dbf042003fdbc2418c697f299251071cb"}}, "hash": "ef047bb201eaea7ee28038a1bf5c323dbf042003fdbc2418c697f299251071cb", "text": "HICL  Annual Report 2023100\nKPMG LLP\u2019s Independent Auditor\u2019s Report continued\nTo the members of HICL Infrastructure plc\n3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties \nThe directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Company or to cease its \noperations, and as they have concluded that the Company\u2019s financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over its ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (\u201cthe going concern period\u201d). \nGoing concern \nWe used our knowledge of the Company, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Company\u2019s financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that management considered most likely to adversely affect the available financial resources over this period are:\n\u2013\n Op\nerational or performance issues within the portfolio which \nincreases the number of projects not distributing and its impact on \nthe Company\u2019s distribution income and cash flows; and \n\u2013 Wi\ndespread economic turmoil due to volatility in the financial \nmarkets and recovery alongside geopolitical uncertainties contributing to persistent inflation impacting liquidity through the need to provide further liquidity support to the portfolio. \nWe considered whether this risk could plausibly affect the liquidity or covenant compliance in the investment entity in the going concern period by assessing the degree of downside assumption that, individually and collectively, could result in a liquidity issue, taking into account the Company\u2019s current and projected cash and facilities (a stress test). \nOur procedures also included an assessment of whether the going \nconcern disclosure in note 2 to the financial statements gives a complete and accurate description of the directors\u2019 assessment of going concern. \nAccordingly, based on those procedures, we found the directors\u2019 use of \nthe going concern basis of accounting without any material uncertainty for the Company to be acceptable. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Company will continue in operation.Our conclusions\n\u2013 We consider that the directors\u2019 use of the going concern basis o\nf accounting in the preparation of the financial statements \nis appropriate; \n\u2013 We h\nave not identified, and concur with the directors\u2019 assessment \nthat there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n\u2013\n We h\nave nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the \ndirectors\u2019 statement in note 2 to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Company\u2019s use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in note 2 to be acceptable; and \n\u2013\n Th\ne related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page \n92 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e1e6afa-b259-4a23-b359-e9437f8c3620": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e1e6afa-b259-4a23-b359-e9437f8c3620", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ae2e5167-5876-464f-b5b0-c72403586067", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "8a2989a618c51d157d85dec691c7a695156b2bb86a575ace7bcaadacac3f3551"}}, "hash": "7e7f76b6bebe201645b86222218e2f3f9bb96bd4bf7bfa28880b908af2d45407", "text": "Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 2023101\nDisclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability \nOur responsibility \nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a \nmaterial inconsistency between the directors\u2019 disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge. \nBased on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw \nattention to in relation to: \n\u2013\n the\n directors\u2019 confirmation within the Risk & Risk Management \nsection on page 53 that they have carried out a robust assessment \nof the emerging and principal risks facing the Company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity; \n\u2013\n th\ne Emerging and Principal Risks disclosures describing these \nrisks and how emerging risks are identified and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and \n\u2013\n the\n directors\u2019 explanation in the viability statement of how they \nhave assessed the prospects of the Company, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. \nWe are also required to review the viability statement set out on page 64 under the Listing Rules. \nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only \nthe knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit.

IILP invests in a number of infrastructure, PFI and PPP projects. \nThe valuation of HICL SARL represents its net asset value, which \nis based on the net asset value of IILP. The net asset value of IILP is determined primarily based on the valuation of the underlying infrastructure, PFI and PPP projects. \nAs these investments (except for one), are unquoted and illiquid, \nthe fair value is determined using discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology, whereby long-term forecasted cash flows derived from revenue, expenses and financing streams for each asset are discounted at a rate reflecting the risk profile. This involves the exercise of significant judgement by the Company in relation to the selection of a number of assumptions and data points which are unobservable in the market. \nThese include: Significant assumption: \nThe discount rate has a high degree of estimation uncertainty with a potential range of reasonable outcomes (valuations) greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. \nNon significant assumptions and data\u00a0points: \nWhilst we do not consider other assumptions and data points to be at a significant risk of misstatement, due to the relevance of these elements in terms of the overall valuation and associated audit effort, we consider the following areas to also have the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy and planning of the audit: \n\u2013\n In\nflation\n\u2013 GD\nP Growth Rates \n\u2013 De\nposit and Tax rates \n\u2013 Pr\noject revenue and expenses \n\u2013 Ma\nnagement overlay adjustments to cash flow \nThe financial statements (note 14) disclose the sensitivity estimated by \nthe Company.Our response to the risk\nOur procedures included: \nControl design: \nWe obtained an understanding of the Company\u2019s processes to determine the fair value of investments. We documented and assessed the design and implementation of the investment valuation processes and controls. \nWe performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the \nCompany\u2019s controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described. \nRisk assessment and understanding of the investments \nWe held discussions with the asset manager to identify any specific operational issues relating to the investments, and assessed the impact of these issues on the forecasted distributions and discount rate. \nManagement expert \nWe assessed the objectivity, capabilities and competence of the third party valuation expert engaged by the Company to challenge the reasonableness of the Company\u2019s investment valuations. We obtained and assessed the valuation expert\u2019s findings, held discussions with them and considered the impact, if any, on our audit work. \nOur procedures for significant assumptions included: Our valuations experience: \nWith the assistance of our valuations specialists, we critically evaluated and challenged the significant assumption affecting the valuation of the underlying assets (discount rates). We assessed whether the discount rates are within a reasonable range independently developed by us based on market data. \nTest of detail: \nOur procedures in respect of the non-significant assumptions and data points included: \n\u2013\n We a\ngreed key revenue inputs on the forecast cash flows for each \ninvestment to external sources, such as third party contracts and \ninvoices.

The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with companies in the same sectors as the Company operates, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise.\nRisk  \ncommunications We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. \nFraud risks As required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit or investment valuation targets and our overall knowledge of the control environment, we performed procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that the Company may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgements. On this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because of the simplistic nature of income, which principally comprises dividend and interest income. We deemed that there is limited opportunity to manipulate income recognition. \nProcedures to  \naddress fraud risksOur audit procedures included evaluating the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of internal controls relevant to mitigate these risks.\nWe also performed procedures including: \u2013\n id\nentifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting \ndocumentation.

In setting overall materiality, we applied a percentage of 1% (FY22: 1% of net assets) to this benchmark.\nThere is a change to our materiality benchmark from Net assets to Total assets in the current year.

We may become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud. \nThis is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to HICL Infrastructure plc\u2019s \nAudit Committee.\nBasis for determining the audit misstatement posting threshold and judgements applied\nWe set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 5% (FY22: 5%) of our materiality for the financial statements.

Respective responsibilities \nDirectors\u2019 responsibilities \nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 93, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements \nincluding being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. \nAuditor\u2019s responsibilities \nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor\u2019s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. \nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC\u2019s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. The Company is required to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared using the single electronic reporting format \nspecified in the TD ESEF Regulation. This auditor\u2019s report provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared in accordance with that format. \n10. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities \nThis report is made solely to the Company\u2019s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company\u2019s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor\u2019s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company\u2019s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. \nFang Fang Zhou (Senior Statutory Auditor) \nfor and on behalf of KPMG LLP, Statutory Auditor \nChartered Accountants \n15 Canada Square  \nCanary Wharf  \nLondon  \nE14 5GL  \n23 May 2023", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9be94698-1bb4-409d-a7c0-38cc9ca92fb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "9be94698-1bb4-409d-a7c0-38cc9ca92fb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e12eef4-a7f1-4e17-935c-fed1812a4c95", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "1d7d12fa927bac49c171feccef6ea376cbc8c591fc023429e62867927c37420a"}}, "hash": "1d7d12fa927bac49c171feccef6ea376cbc8c591fc023429e62867927c37420a", "text": "HICL  Annual Report 2023 110\nNoteYear ended \n 31 March 2023\n \n\u00a3mYear ended \n31 March 2022  \n \n\u00a3m\nDividends received 151.5 79.3\nInterest received 17.5 80.5\nNet gain on revaluation of investment in Investment Entity subsidiary 33.3 212.0\nTotal investment income 5 202.3 371.8\nCompany expenses 6 (3.9) (3.1)\nProfit before tax 198.4 368.7\nTax \u2013 \u2013\nProfit for the year 9 198.4 368.7\nEarnings per share \u2013 basic and diluted (pence) 9 9.9 19.0\nAll results are derived from continuing operations.

Reporting entity\nHICL Infrastructure PLC (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cHICL \u201d) is a public limited \ncompany incorporated, domiciled and registered in England and Wales in the United Kingdom. The financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2023 comprise the financial statements for the Company only as explained in Note 2.\nThe Company has two Corporate Subsidiaries being HICL \nInfrastructure 2 S.a.r.l. (\u201cLuxco\u201d) and Infrastructure Investments Limited Partnership (\u201cIILP\u201d) (each a \u201cCorporate Subsidiary\u201d and together the \u201cCorporate Subsidiaries\u201d). IILP is a direct subsidiary of Luxco.\nThe Company and its Corporate Subsidiaries (together the \n\u201cCorporate Group\u201d) invest in infrastructure projects in the United Kingdom, Eurozone, North America and New Zealand.\n2. Key accounting policies\nBasis of preparation\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (\u201cIFRSs\u201d).\nThe financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is \nthe Company\u2019s functional currency. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements are shown below. These policies have been consistently applied.\nGoing concern\nThe Company\u2019s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in HICL \u2019s Business Model section on page 14. The financial position of the Company, its cash flows, and liquidity position are described in the Financial Review on page 40. In addition, Notes 2 to 17 of the financial statements include the Company\u2019s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.\nThe Directors have assessed going concern by considering areas \nof financial risk, the Company\u2019s access to the Revolving Credit Facility and Letter of Credit Facility (details of which are set out in the Financial Review starting on page 40) as well as the \u00a3150m Private Placement issue and by reviewing cash flow forecasts under severe but plausible stress scenarios for at least 12 months after the approval of the financial statements.\nThey also considered the Company\u2019s considerable financial \nresources, including indirect investments in a significant number of project assets. The going concern analysis included an assessment of the potential variability in returns and cash flows from project companies including the effects of the heightened macroeconomic volatility on demand assets as well as availability assets. The Directors also noted that the financing for project companies is non-recourse to the Company.Based on this analysis, the Directors have concluded that the Company has adequate resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approving these financial statements (\u201cthe going concern period\u201d). Thus, they consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.\nNew and revised standards \nThere are no new or amended accounting standards or interpretations adopted during the year that have a significant impact on the financial statements. The Company notes the following standards and interpretations which were in issue but not effective at the date of these financial statements. They are not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements. \n\u2013\n IF\nRS 17: Insurance contracts (effective for accounting periods \nbeginning on or after 1 January 2023)\n\u2013 Am\nendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or \nNoncurrent (effective date of 1 January 2024)\n\u2013 Am\nendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure \nof Accounting Policies (effective for accounting periods beginning \non or after 1 January 2023)\n\u2013 Am\nendments to IAS 8: Definition of Accounting Estimate (effective \nfor accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023)\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a119b3c1-1a53-4da7-bb43-24b23af68f10": {"__data__": {"id_": "a119b3c1-1a53-4da7-bb43-24b23af68f10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30b8540d-5db3-4000-bd6f-c94e3d59699a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "80b4c0644630314d6e56a6d1c94b5b0dafce5af69a929cff538c842e900ce8f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "43b5c940-f20f-42e0-9762-5d3cfd2a809c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "b83c148366e52d9a19fcffc1655bbbbe83fcd7d4419d57bc1d132e42f4da64f1"}}, "hash": "472d822b11261ef0d73da5f25788c7b28385bfd1c9d6d0a43f53ad1e49932e76", "text": "Financial assets and liabilities are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the instrument expire or the asset or liability is transferred and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IFRS 9 \u2018Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement\u2019.\nNon-derivative financial instruments \n Non-derivative financial instruments comprise the Company\u2019s investment in the equity and debt of its direct Corporate Subsidiary, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.\n Non-d\nerivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair \nvalue including directly attributable transaction costs, except for financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Interest income or expenses, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in the Income Statement. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in the Income Statement.\nFair values\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in absence, the most advantageous market to which the Company has access at that date. \nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s investment in Luxco is based on the \nNet Asset Value of IILP and the sundry assets and liabilities of Luxco. IILP\u2019s Net Asset Value is based on the fair value of the underlying investments in its portfolio of infrastructure assets, since IILP manages these investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value.\nThe fair value of IILP\u2019s underlying investments are determined using \nthe income approach, which discounts the expected cash flows attributable to each asset at an appropriate rate to arrive at its fair value. In determining the appropriate discount rate, regard is given to relevant long-term government bond yields, the specific risks of each investment and the evidence of recent transactions. Further detail on methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the financial instruments is included in Note 14.\nInvestment income \nInvestment income comprises interest income, dividend income and gains/(losses) on investments, which comprise the change in fair value of the Company\u2019s direct subsidiary. Interest income is recognised in the Income Statement based on a calculation specified within the financing loan agreement with Luxco. Dividend income is recognised when the Company\u2019s right to receive payment is established.\nShare capital and share premium\nOrdinary Shares are classified as equity. Costs associated with the establishment of the Company or directly attributable to the issue of new shares are recognised as a deduction from the share premium account. Equity and reserves\nThe Company is a UK approved Investment Trust Company. Financial statements prepared under IFRS are not strictly required to apply the provisions of the Statements of Recommended Practice issued by the UK Association of Investment Companies for the financial statements of Investment Trust Companies (the \u201cSORP\u201d). However, where relevant and appropriate, the Directors have looked to follow the recommendations of the SORP. The Directors have chosen to rename distributable and other reserves into a Revenue reserve and a Capital reserve respectively. The Directors have exercised their judgement in applying the SORP and a summary of these judgements are as follows:\n\u2013\n Ne\nt gains on investments are applied wholly to the Capital reserve \nas they relate to the revaluation or disposal of investments;\n\u2013 Di\nvidends are applied to the Revenue reserve except under specific \ncircumstances where a dividend arises from a return of capital \nor proceeds from a refinancing, when they are applied to the Capital reserve;\n\u2013\n Fe\nes payable are applied to the Capital reserve where the service \nprovided is, in substance, an intrinsic part of an intention to acquire or dispose of an investment;\n\u2013\n Ma\nnagement fees are applied to the Revenue reserve as they \nreflect ongoing asset management. Where a transaction fee element is due on the acquisition of an investment it is applied to the Capital reserve;\n\u2013\n Op\nerating costs are applied wholly to the Revenue reserve as there \nis no clear connection between the operating expenses of the Company and the purchase and sale of an investment;\n\u2013\n Fi\nnance costs are applied wholly to the Revenue reserve as the \nexisting borrowing is not directly linked to an investment; and\n\u2013 Fo\nreign exchange movements are applied to the Revenue reserve \nwhere they relate to movements on non-portfolio assets.\nCapital management\nThe Company aims to operate within a gearing range of up to 20% of Gross Asset Value, in line with the Board\u2019s approved investment policy, to allow it to fund new investments. The Company is an Investment Trust and looks to raise equity to fund its acquisitions as soon as practicable once the level of acquisitions gets to an appropriate level. In addition to equity, the Company will use long-term debt to fund investments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17ac5613-c37b-4308-87d5-5afeb928c07e": {"__data__": {"id_": "17ac5613-c37b-4308-87d5-5afeb928c07e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f92e5373-6b17-4ede-b42a-6ccca83543bd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "ffab9bdb9a0c8da4e7088922d8bcf5d046c166489931d8845a35136adeee8a03"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ccb49fd-c15c-4303-aa0d-e0d709cc77a9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "4ce23b4a69fa3b86a749962402b9eb524266b1980af32535ae7961531f762f3e"}}, "hash": "d5e225be941d887cd1015950d10b8ba092ad4c60bd6e9d0abbf5f452e3754292", "text": "In addition to equity, the Company will use long-term debt to fund investments.\nCash and cash equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents held by the Company comprise cash balances, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Key accounting policies continued\nIncome tax\nIncome tax represents the sum of the tax currently payable and \ndeferred tax. Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. Tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nForeign exchange gains and losses\nTransactions entered into by the Company in a currency other than its functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the re-translation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. \nExpenses\nAll expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis. The Company\u2019s investment management fee, administration fees and all other expenses are charged through the Income Statement.\nDividends payable\nDividends payable to the Company\u2019s shareholders are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends, this is when they are paid. In the case of final dividends, this is when they are approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. \nSegmental reporting\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker (the \u201cCODM\u201d) has been determined to be the Board, who are of the opinion that the Company is engaged in a single segment of business, being the investment in infrastructure. The Company has no single major customer.\nThe internal financial information used by the CODM on a quarterly \nbasis to allocate resources, assess performance and manage the Company presents the business as a single segment comprising the portfolio of investments in infrastructure assets.\n3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates \nand assumptions\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with UK \nadopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the disclosure or to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are outlined below.\nKey judgements\nInvestment Entities\nThe Company has applied IFRS 10 \u2018Consolidated Financial \nStatements\u2019, IFRS 11 \u2018Joint Arrangements\u2019 and IFRS 12 \u2018Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities\u2019 in these financial statements, which require investment entities to measure certain subsidiaries, including those that are themselves investment entities, at fair value through the Income Statement, rather than consolidating their results. To determine that the Company continues to meet the definition of an investment entity the Company is required to satisfy the following three criteria:\n\u2013\n It\n obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose \nof providing these investors with professional investment \nmanagement services;\n\u2013 It c\nommits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest \nits funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income or both; and\n\u2013\n It m\neasures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its \ninvestments on a fair value basis.\nThe Corporate Subsidiaries carry out investment activities and incur overheads and borrowings on behalf of the Company. They are considered investment entities themselves and are therefore measured at fair value in these financial statements. \nConsistent with previous years, the Company meets the criteria due \nto the following reasons:\n\u2013\n It d\nelivers stable returns to shareholders through a mix of income \nyield and capital appreciation;\n\u2013 It p\nrovides investment management services and has several \ninvestors who pool their funds to gain access to infrastructure-\nrelated investment opportunities that they might not have had access to individually; and\n\u2013\n It h\nas elected to measure and evaluate the performance of all its \ninvestments on a fair value basis.

As part of its analysis, the Directors have considered the potential impact of a change in a number of the macroeconomic assumptions used in the valuation process. By considering these potential scenarios, the Directors are well positioned to assess how the Company is likely to perform if affected by variables and events that are inherently outside of the control of the Directors and the Investment Manager.\nSensitivities\nIn order to give investors a meaningful sensitivity analysis, the Directors have considered how changes in macroeconomic assumptions in the underlying assets for which the Company holds an indirect interest would affect the investment that the Company has in its direct Investment Entity subsidiary, rather than the sensitivity in the Investment Entity subsidiary. Consequently, the following numbers are presented on the Investment Basis, with the sensitivity having the same impact on both net assets and total investment income.

These figures have been restated using a sensitivity of 1.0% in order to be comparable to current year figures\nThe Directors have considered the increase in volatility in markets and have increased the sensitivity measure from 0.5% to 1.0%. The sensitivity \nassumes that the changes are for all future periods. The increase is consistent with that shown by the Company\u2019s listed infrastructure peers and this allows for comparisons to be made. A higher sensitivity is not considered necessary as the mix of the portfolio means that the sensitivity is linear and it is possible to estimate the impact if percentage changes are in multiples of this sensitivity. \nThe Directors recognise that current levels of macroeconomic volatility are likely to give rise to materially greater possible ranges of values than \nhas been the case for a number of years. \n15.

Financial risk management\nA review of the Corporate Group\u2019s objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Risk management section on page 70. This Note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk management section where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specific financial risks. The Corporate Group is exposed to market risk (which includes currency risk, interest rate risk and inflation risk), credit risk and liquidity risk arising from the financial instruments it holds through IILP as disclosed below. The Corporate Group, via IILP, owns a portfolio of investments predominantly in the subordinated loanstock and equity of project companies. These companies are structured at the outset to minimise financial risks where possible. Ongoing risk management occurs through the individual boards of the project companies and monitored through regular financial and operational performance reports.\nMarket risk\nReturns from HICL \u2019s investments are affected by market events giving rise to changes in the value of underlying portfolio assets. The value of these investments will be a function of the discounted value of their expected future cash flows and as such will vary with, inter alia, movements in interest rates, market prices and the competition for such assets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f39073c6-dcfd-47c5-9f75-98ac5e97d627": {"__data__": {"id_": "f39073c6-dcfd-47c5-9f75-98ac5e97d627", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a9b1541c-be1d-4725-9293-09e8278efaab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "666e9e9ed28d6b39c5160bb619b93637eb4e03100a65fca094d00d5383ea1548"}, "3": {"node_id": "8475ac09-9a66-40d6-adc8-5622980d991a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "196de176536a0fa9efaeed0760659a7661b99eddd55d687ada7f0d497ad6f7a0"}}, "hash": "2b554198dc64819caa40d09d6702d719068aa282fca87fec2d31ab91c42c67ac", "text": "HICL  Annual Report 2023124\n17. Financial risk management continued\nAs at 31 March 2023, the portfolio had five investments which are considered sensitive to GDP, comprising 18% of the portfolio value (21% \nat 31 March 2022): namely, the A63, M1-A1 Road, RMG Roads, NWP and HS1. At times of higher economic activity there will be greater traffic volumes using these roads and railways, generating increased revenues for the projects than compared to periods of lower economic activity and they are categorised as GDP sensitive investments.\nInterest rate risk\nThe Corporate Group has indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance and the valuation of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations in loans and borrowings. The Company itself does not have any borrowings but does have an interest-bearing loan with Luxco and therefore is exposed to interest rate risk. The sensitivity of the portfolio companies to interest rates is shown in Note 14. \nInflation risk\nThe infrastructure project companies in which the Corporate Group invests are generally structured so that contractual income and costs are either wholly or partially linked to specific inflation where possible to minimise the risks of mismatch between income and costs due to movements in inflation. The Corporate Group\u2019s overall cash flows vary with inflation, although they are not fully correlated as not all flows are indexed. The effects of inflation changes do not always immediately flow through to the Corporate Group\u2019s cash flows, particularly where a project\u2019s loanstock debt carries a fixed coupon and the inflation changes flow through by way of changes to dividends in future periods. As RPI is to be aligned with CPIH from 2030, RPI linked project companies have been aligned to CPIH from this date. The sensitivity of the Corporate Group to inflation is shown on page 50.\nCurrency risk\nThe Corporate Group monitors its foreign exchange exposures using its near-term and long-term cash flow forecasts. Its policy is to use foreign exchange hedging to provide protection against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the level of sterling distributions that the Corporate Group expects to receive over the medium term, where considered appropriate. This may involve the use of forward exchange and other currency hedging contracts at IILP level, as well as the use of Euro, Canadian dollar, US dollar, NZ dollar and other currency denominated borrowings. At 31 March 2023, the Corporate Group, via IILP, hedged its currency exposure through Euro, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar and US dollar forward contracts. This has reduced the volatility in the NAV from foreign exchange movements. \nThe hedging policy is designed to provide confidence in the near-term yield and to limit NAV per share sensitivity to no more than 2% for a 10% \nforeign exchange movement. The sensitivity of the Corporate Group to currency risk is shown on page 50.\nCredit risk \nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty of the Corporate Group will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Corporate Group. \nThe Corporate Group is subject to credit risk on its loans, receivables, cash and deposits. The Corporate Group\u2019s cash and deposits are held \nwith reputable banks. The credit quality of loans and receivables within the Investment Portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies. For those assets that are not past due, it is believed that the risk of default is small and capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the investment. \nThe Corporate Group\u2019s maximum exposure to credit risk over financial assets is the carrying value of those assets in the balance sheet. \nThe Corporate Group does not hold any collateral as security.\nLiquidity risk\nThe table below analyses the Company\u2019s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8475ac09-9a66-40d6-adc8-5622980d991a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8475ac09-9a66-40d6-adc8-5622980d991a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a9b1541c-be1d-4725-9293-09e8278efaab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "666e9e9ed28d6b39c5160bb619b93637eb4e03100a65fca094d00d5383ea1548"}, "2": {"node_id": "f39073c6-dcfd-47c5-9f75-98ac5e97d627", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "126", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "2b554198dc64819caa40d09d6702d719068aa282fca87fec2d31ab91c42c67ac"}}, "hash": "196de176536a0fa9efaeed0760659a7661b99eddd55d687ada7f0d497ad6f7a0", "text": "31 March 2023Less than  \n1 year  \n\u00a3mBetween 1  \nand 2 years  \n\u00a3mBetween 2  \nand 5 years  \n\u00a3mMore than  \n5 years  \n\u00a3m\nTrade and other payables 1.1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nTotal 1.1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n31 March 2022Less than  \n1 year \u00a3mBetween 1  \n and 2 years  \n\u00a3mBetween 2  \nand 5 years  \n\u00a3mMore than  \n5 years  \n\u00a3m\nTrade and other payables 0.8 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nTotal 0.8 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013Notes to the financial statements continued\nFor the year ended 31 March 2023", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ef0acd1-d9bb-41d4-9abe-97af74211dee": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ef0acd1-d9bb-41d4-9abe-97af74211dee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "790dbe34-991a-4b40-967b-9995604a9dcf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "68e35fb6f62f8d0248f05b966bdd441f4d2e6e0f9daf74c8795b9b0d7ac12286"}, "3": {"node_id": "4442dba1-5dc3-4900-b425-72accfcf93cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "8cbe662b7bbd9e4a75da500d5860f2c369ede0abdd6320eb924c559a350eb6d6"}}, "hash": "c6fcc87c0be94281736df31b03949dbf3c56de2b04fd97292482804299b22f93", "text": "Overview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 2023125\n18.

An example of one of HICL's social initiatives over the \npast year is in one of its healthcare assets. East Lancashire Hospital\u2019s Trust Charity, \nELHT&Me, was looking to move its operations to a more prominent location to increase public exposure. Blackburn Hospital had two vacant retail units at its main entrance which provide \nan ideal location for obtaining maximum impact. The units were converted into the Charity Hub, which is now home to the Charity\u2019s shop, a donation desk and office for the Charity staff , \nwho run the shop and organise events. \nThe Hub provides an inclusive, accessible space for all within the local community, \nparticularly the most vulnerable. The retail outlet stocks popular items at extremely competitive prices, so people with less can also donate while accessing what they need, a particularly important factor in the current economic climate.  \nWith the initiative completed, a new and previously unobtainable revenue stream has been created for the Charity resulting in spend now reaching areas formerly infeasible, such as on essential medical equipment. Consequently, the project has enhanced the Charity\u2019s ability to \ngive more back to the Trust for years to come.     are \nsustainable \ninvestments with an environmental objective that do \nnot take into account the criteria  \nfor environmentally sustainable economic activities under Regulation (EU) 2020/852.  \n \nOverview Strategic Report Governance Financials HICL  Annual Report 2023155", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38ec1dcc-5ad6-4826-84a9-92cff25f8a13": {"__data__": {"id_": "38ec1dcc-5ad6-4826-84a9-92cff25f8a13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "65258eb7-d241-49ce-9e17-23bafad9917d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\HICL-Annual-Report-2023.pdf", "creation_date": "2023-11-16", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-13", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-16"}, "hash": "0ddb67d5161d01ea024bee768a2109be87f5e8bf90cf24597c8ca432e5347bd9"}}, "hash": "69e2978b5deb785898b7133528200c9839bf2e1688df2b266fdfe7b85e34a7ea", "text": "To ensure our initiatives  drive positive social outcomes across the portfolio, InfraRed created \na Portfolio Impact Strategy . To gain a deeper insight into what operational and other \nchallenges the people working at our assets are facing, the portfolio impact team created The \nClient Insights survey. The survey was designed to capture the social challenges and \nsatisfaction of the client teams that lead our healthcare and education assets.  In 2022, the \nsurvey was sent out for the second time since its inception. We more than tripled our response rate from 2021 and donated over \u00a330k to causes nominated by our clients to \nencourage them to submit the survey. From the survey we saw key themes emerge which have led us in our thinking and subsequent creation of new social sustainability initiatives  \nacross HICL\u2019s portfolio.  \nEnvironment:  \nHICL's key themes for environment surround biodiversity, resources and climate c hange. In \n2022 for biodiversity Affinity Water, one of HICL\u2019s assets, relaunched the \u2018INNS OUT\u2019 scheme \nfor a second year, as part of an ongoing commitment to protect and enhance the habitats of \nnative wildlife on its land and across its supply area by reducing the spread and introduction \nof Invasive Non -Native Species (INNS). INNS have a negative impact on the economy and \nwildlife habitats, threatening native species by spreading harmful diseases, out -competing for \nresources, or damaging natural ecosystems.  \nThrough the scheme, the company has engaged with 20 local community groups and organisations to help stop the spread of INNS across multiple river catchments in the supply area. The support was both \u2018in kind\u2019 with over 35 Affinity staff committing over 50 volunteer \ndays towards the scheme, and financial with 16 projects receiving support totaling  \u00a365,000. \nThe scheme demonstrated that a joint approach to working with other organisations to \ncombine resources and expertise is key to improving the local environment. The scheme will \nreopen again for 2023, building on the work that has already been undertaken and expanding \ninto new areas.  \nIn regards to resources, as a result of the ESG survey responses , \nthis year the Managers \nresource focus has centred around reducing water consumption and the quantity of waste \ndisposed. Consumption habits vary significantly across the portfolio, however through the \nESG survey responses InfraRed can i dentify sector specific trends and then support with \nscalable initiatives. For example, several single use plastic initiatives have been rolled out \nacross some of HICL\u2019s education assets with an aim to roll out portfolio wide in this sector.  \nHICL\u2019s actions this year in the field of climate change are presented below in two parts; Net \nzero and Emissions.  \nNet zero: \nHICL\u2019s Investment Manager, InfraRed , reinforced its commitment to reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions by publishing its 2022 Net Zero Progress Report which outlined interim \ntargets set as part of their net zero commitment.
