TRIG\u2019s IPO in 2013, the Company \nhas consistently provided shareholders with \nsustainable returns from its diversified portfolio of \nrenewable infrastructure assets. I am delighted to \nhave joined TRIG as Chairman of the Board and \nam pleased to report that we delivered a NAV total \nreturn15 for 2022 of 18.9%.\nTRIG\u2019s diversified portfolio remains resilient against a backdrop of \nhigher inflation and interest rates, benefiting from strong inflation \ncorrelation and elevated power prices.\nInfraRed, as Investment Manager, and RES, as Operations \nManager, continue to enhance the Company\u2019s portfolio both \norganically through value enhancement initiatives , including the \nconstruction of 378MW of new generation capacity16, and also \nthrough acquisitions, with investments made into operating assets \nduring the year totalling 297MW of generation capacity17.\nThe Board remains grateful for the ongoing support of TRIG\u2019s \nshareholders. The case for investment in renewables has never \nbeen stronger, particularly in the context of the immediate \nenergy security and affordability challenges, as well as the \ndecarbonisation agenda. TRIG offers investors access to \notherwise illiquid renewables infrastructure and the opportunity for \nparticipation in  the net zero transition. The Company is also very \nwell supported by Managers who share the Board\u2019s commitment \nto providing sustainable income and capital growth through \ninvesting in the transition to net zero.\nIncreases in interest rates during the year and the impact of the \nUK mini-budget have led to a sustained period of share prices \ntrading at discounts to Net Asset Values across real assets \ninvestments companies. Specifically for the energy sub-sector, \ngovernments\u2019 interventions have also weighed on investor \nsentiment. In this context, TRIG\u2019s diverse portfolio, which \nhas been stress -tested through the pandemic and the more \nrecent energy crisis, ensures that the Company is strategically \nwell positioned in 2023 to continue to enhance value for \nshareholders and contribute to greater energy security and faster \ndecarbonisation.\n15  Based on NAV per share appreciation plus dividends paid during the year ended 31 December 2022. \n16  From 1 January 2022 to 21 February 2023.

Earnings for 2022 were \n21.5p per share. The material drivers of this strong financial \nperformance in the year were:\n\t\u25b2The Managers\u2019 ongoing delivery of active asset management \nto maximise operational performance and additive \ninvestments, providing greater geographic and technological \ndiversification .\n\t\u25b2Increases in wholesale power prices and inflation, which feed \ninto the Company\u2019s revenues and portfolio valuation.\nTo some extent offset by:\n\t\u25b2An increase in valuation discount rates of 50bps on a weighted \naverage basis across the portfolio. The long-term, inflation-\ncorrelated and lower risk, sustainable nature of renewables \ninfrastructure underpins the demand for assets.\n\t\u25b2Intervention by governments across Europe in the electricity \ngeneration sector, in particular the UK Government\u2019s Electricity \nGenerator Levy and the European Council mandated cap \non inframarginal (non-gas) generator revenues, which were \nannounced in November 2022 and September 2022, \nrespectively.\nOver the next ten years, 63% of TRIG\u2019s forecast revenues are \ndirectly linked to inflation through subsidy support mechanisms, \nwith the majority of remaining revenues indirectly linked to inflation \ndue to the relationship between power prices and inflation indices , \nproviding strong inflation protection.

TRIG has delivered five projects from reinvested \nexcess cash  flows including Arenosas, El Yarte and Blary Hill in \n2022, and continues to fund construction commitments at the \nRanasj\u00f6 and Salsj\u00f6 onshore wind farms in Sweden  from revenues \ngenerated by the portfolio .\nInvestment activity\nThe identification of accretive acquisitions is key to portfolio \nconstruction for TRIG. The Company\u2019s investment strategy \nremains unchanged, targeting renewables and related \ninfrastructure investments21 in the UK and mainland Europe22.\nTRIG\u2019s largest investment during the period was a 10% stake in \nthe 1.2GW Hornsea One offshore wind farm in the UK. The Group \nalso made an incremental investment in the Merkur offshore wind \nfarm in Germany, a project we are very familiar with having first \ninvested in 2019. Offshore wind farms have an important role to \nplay in the portfolio: each of our six offshore wind projects benefits \nfrom protected cash flows for the term of their government support \narrangements, which reduces the sensitivity of their equity returns \nto changes in power price levels. These investments help to \nfacilitate the addition of unsubsidised , higher -returning projects into \nthe portfolio, such as the March 2022 acquisition of a 49% stake in \nthe Valdesolar solar park in Spain, whilst maintaining the portfolio\u2019s \noverall power price sensitivity.\nConstruction and development assets offer a source of higher \nrisk-adjusted returns too. We are grateful to shareholders for their \nsupport at the 2022 AGM to increase TRIG\u2019s construction and \ndevelopment investment limit from 15% to 25%. In 2022, TRIG \nacquired four development-stage battery storage sites, which will \nprovide c. 700MWh / 350MW flexible capacity once built. Flexible \ncapacity, which includes battery storage, is critical to the energy \ntransition and complements TRIG\u2019s renewable generation assets \nas it respond s, and financially benefits from, the intermittency \nof renewables and electricity price volatility. At the period end, \nconstruction and development exposure represented 8% of the \ntotal portfolio.\nPortfolio performance\nOverall portfolio electricity generation in the year was 5% below \nbudget  due to lower than expected weather resource in some \ngeographies and downtime resulting from both enhancement \nactivities and unscheduled maintenance . Further detail is provided \nin Section 2.3 \u2013 Operations Report.\n78MW of generation capacity was constructed during the year  \nat Haut Vannier and Blary Hill onshore wind farms , with Blary Hill \nin Scotland fully funded from re-investment proceeds. 301MW of \n20  The Company\u2019s dividend policy is to increase the dividend when the Board considers it prudent to do so, considering forecast cash flows, expected dividend \ncover, inflation across TRIG\u2019s key markets, the outlook for electricity prices and the operational performance of the Company\u2019s portfolio. \n21  Including onshore wind, offshore wind, solar PV and flexible capacity technologies.

Earnings for \n2022 were 21.5p/share (2021: 10.0p/share). Dividends of 6.84p \nper share w ere declared , giving an increase in NAV per share of \n15.3p (2021  NAV per share increase:  4.0p).\nThe earnings o f 21.5p/share  in the year were a result of:\n\t\u25b2Continued delivery of the investment strategy and active \nportfolio management\n\t\u25b2The high revenues generated in the year as a result of \nparticularly high wholesale power prices coupled with higher \nsubsidies as a result of inflation indexation passing  through\n\t\u25b2Increases in the portfolio valuation as a result of \nexpectations for power prices and inflation to continue to \nbe elevated over the short  to medium term  compared to \nexpectations last year\n\t\u25b2The portfolio valuation increase has been offset to some \nextent by an  increase in the portfolio weighted average \ndiscount rate of 0.5%, recognising the increased levels of \ngovernment bond yields. The discount rate applied to UK \ncash flows were increased by 0.8%, whilst the equivalent \nrate applied in Europe was increased by 0.3%, recognising \nthe increased macro-economic volatility in the UK in the \nsecond half of the year\nGreater detail on these movements can be found in Section \n3.1\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Valuation of the Portfolio.\nNet cash flow for 2022 was \u00a3 249m30 (2021: \u00a3 150m) resulting in \ndividend cover for the year of 1.5x before the benefit of scrip take -\nup (2021: 1.06x). With the benefit of scrip take -up, dividend cover \nfor the year was 1.55x (2021: 1.12x). Net cash flows in 2022 \nbenefited from high achieved power prices during the period.\nDividend cover is stated after the repayment of project-level \namortising debt, reflecting the Company\u2019s capital structure  and \nprudent debt management which seeks to repay project debt \nduring subsidy periods without reliance on merchant receipts . \n\u00a3174m project-level amortising debt was repaid in 2022 (2021: \n\u00a3145m). Whilst we believe having an amortising debt profile is the \nmost appropriate structure for the Company\u2019s risk profile, capital \nstructures do vary between renewables investment companies. \nWere dividend cover to be calculated based on operating cash \nflows before the repayment of debt, dividend cover for 2022 \nwould have been 2.55x (2021: 2.1x). The Company has declared \na dividend target for 2023 of 7.18p per share, reflecting the h igh \nearnings and  strong cover , but also  recognising the importance \nof the long-term sustainability of the Company\u2019s dividend to \nshareholders.\nThe Group  also utilises a Revolving Credit Facility (\u201cRCF\u201d)  which \nis used to make new investments and is repaid from surplus \n30 On an Expanded Basis.

The Company is partner ed with Repsol, the \nSpanish-listed global energy company . The project  has the \nability to capture merchant power prices .\n\t\u25b2The acquisition of a 10.2% stake in Hornsea One  in the UK , \none of the world\u2019s largest operational offshore wind farms, \nand an incremental investment in the Merkur offshore wind \nfarm taking TRIG\u2019s stake from a 25% to 36% shareholding . \nBoth continue the strategy of investing in projects that \nbenefit from government-backed revenue support. Merkur \nalso benefits  from the current hi gher power prices  due to \nthe functioning of the German Feed-in Tariff which acts as \na floor.\n\t\u25b2A strategic milestone was achieved with a significant  \ninvestment in the flexible capacity sector through the \nacquisition of four in-development battery storage sites. \nThe four projects have grid connection dates ranging \nfrom 2024 to 2031 and, once built, will have combined \ncapacity of 350MW / 700MWh.

Of the 65% fixed over the next 12 months, \n83% are drawn from subsidised projects in the UK, Ireland and France, which benefit from inflation linkage, helping to preserve \nPortfolio Value.

The portfolio is well positioned to benefit from inflation protection whilst the Company\u2019s \nprudent capital structure ensures debt is repaid and has fixed costs, providing strong downside resilience to higher interest rates.\nThe critical themes of energy security, affordability and decarbonisation, together \u201cthe energy trilemma\u201d, underpin the positive outlook \nfor renewables. Once built, renewable energy assets provide secure and locally-generated electricity without carbon emissions. The \nimpetus behind the sector coupled with sustainability considerations should encourage the development of local supply chains and \nreduce the carbon content in construction.\nIn the w ider context, e nergy security and affordability has been brought into sharp focus in 2022. Europe\u2019s dependence on external \nsources of key commodities has been highlighted emphatically by the reduction in Russian gas supply into Europe. Nonetheless, due to \nunseasonably warm weather  spells  across the UK and the European continent and government-guided reduction in energy demand in \nthe EU, Europe is better placed at the end of 2022 than many had feared might be the case. Renewables infrastructure will also play an \nincreasingly critical role in delivering further European energy independence.\nIn addition, decarbonisation and the transition to net zero remain central to government energy strategies, while elevated energy costs \nto consumers highlight the essential requirement for increased domestic generating capacity to make energy more affordable for all.\nCritical investment in the flexibility of grids is needed to balance the intermittency of renewables and improve reliability.

RES applies a structured framework to identify, appraise and implement \nenhancements at both individual and portfolio levels. Examples of some of the commercial and technical value enhancements secured \nin 2022 include:\n\t\u25b2Blade improvements: Aerodynamic improvements to wind turbine blades have been developed with specialist , independent \nexperts to increase the efficiency of the blades in extracting energy from the wind. This enhancement has been rolled out at a \nScottish onshore wind site following a successful trial, in which a 3% increase in energy yield was secured. Trials allow the site-\nspecific conditions to be evaluated, including the turbine model and condition, local topography and wind characteristics such as \nshear and turbulence. A second Scottish site trial is currently underway, with other sites being assessed for further rollout, with \ngreater emphasis on those onshore sites which use larger blades.\n\t\u25b2Software upgrades: More recent vintages of w ind turbine s use sophisticated control systems to determine how the wind turbine \nresponds to the environmental conditions, such as the yawing of the nacelle and pitching of the blades. Some of these software \nupgrades are more  applicable to large turbine arrays with flatter  topography such as offshore wind farms. Alternative software \nenhancements can also be used  to secure improved performance on older turbines within the portfolio.\n\t\u25b2TRIG is actively engaging with its offshore wind joint venture partners to identify and implement  a wide range  energy yield \nenhancements, for implementation during 2023. These enhancements include wake steering \u2013 whereby the overall site \nproduction is increased by reducing the wind obstructed by each turbine on those downwind from them and high wind ride \nthrough \u2013 allowing turbines to respond to and withstand gusting without shutting down whilst also avoiding excessive loading on \nthe structures. RES has a deep experience of both identification, implementation and technical appraisal of the performance of \nsuch enhancements, helping to ensure that appropriate contractual structures are adopted.\n\t\u25b2A wake steering and collective control trial , which seek s to enable turbines to optimise the overall yield from the whole site rather \nthan on a per turbine basis,  is progressing at Altahullion in Northern Ireland, with the next phase of validation to be completed \nin H1 2023. Collective control is expected to be beneficial on any site consisting of a large number of turbines within an array \nformation.\n\t\u25b2Pallas onshore wind farm in the Republic  of Ireland has undergone testing to evaluate the provision of certain specific grid \nservices, supporting grid resilience , for which the site is remunerated by the grid operator.\n\t\u25b2Active revenue stream management: Due to reduced market liquidity in 2022, TRIG ensured a disciplined approach to price \nfixing, whilst also engaged with offtakers to maximise value of REGOs across the portfolio (which have seen a tenfold increase in \nvalue on previous years).\n\t\u25b2Repowering activities are progressing at the four older sites in the south of France , commencing at Claves and Cuxac, then \nfollow ing on at Haut Languedoc and Haut Cabardes thereafter. New 20-year government-supported tariffs have been secured for \nClaves and Cuxac.  Decommissioning and repowering contracts are targeted for signing during the second half of 2023.\n\t\u25b2Work has continued on extending the life of existing operational sites across the wholly owned UK and Ireland portfolio with \nplanning extensions submitted for several solar and wind sites  during the year . In addition, a review of the UK and Ireland onshore \nwind portfolio has been undertaken to identify likely repowering opportunities. Several opportunities have been identified and \nthese will be progressed over the coming years.\nSection Number Heading 0", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79be5b20-d928-4046-842b-e4d8d0c94d98": {"__data__": {"id_": "79be5b20-d928-4046-842b-e4d8d0c94d98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "87df3f81-9694-44a0-98bc-983abb3bc843", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "9ef365a6966662c6bf69f71566da421522b620068526a597c05d6ffe8a8701e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "58fd44d8-774f-4171-a278-6c76c8794eaf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "86c92b3320e85c64628e855d46f8833de51e3a578f680c511ec5a8a00161c4a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "13c2afc8-dbff-48a4-bf9f-38cdd8f2e29b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "a1a2796b4654918cdbd6d3e7434ab6d9ab92202e6348b8cbd0705b9877e1157d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c7adafdbbe8adb0d8d7e9eefeb6cd74968e7311e6d8d1f1e73938dbc74994902", "text": "TRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022 31\nSECTION 2:  \nSTRATEGIC REPORTHealth and Safety\nA strong focus on Health & Safety has always been core to TRIG\u2019s operations and the ethos of its Board and Managers. Each quarterly \nmeeting of the TRIG Board starts with a discussion of Health & Safety across the portfolio. Health & Safety performance is reviewed at \nevery project company board meeting throughout the year, using  reporting obtained for every site in the portfolio, providing information \non both leading and lagging indicators.\nLeading indicators are those activities pro-actively performed or data collated to help reduce the risk of an accident ever occurring, such \nas performing internal or external safety audits, safety-focussed site walk-overs supported by discussions with site personnel, as well as \ncollating and sharing information on:\n\t\u25b2Good Catches \u2013 potential hazards that are identified and controlled;\n\t\u25b2Hazard Identifications \u2013 hazards that have the potential to cause harm but are currently uncontrolled.\nLagging indicators are more focussed on collecting data on events that occurred, ensuring that each is appropriately investigated and \nkey contributing factors identified to enable actions to be taken to reduce future recurrence and severity, including through sharing \ninformation across different businesses. Lagging indicators include:\n\t\u25b2Near-misses \u2013 unplanned or uncontrolled events that have the potential to cause harm or damage.\n\t\u25b2Non-lost time accidents \u2013 where an injury is sustained, however slight, and the injured party is able to return to work on the same \nday as the accident. The difference between a near-miss and a non-lost time accident can often be down to an element of timing, \nseparation or good fortune that broke the chain of events.\n\t\u25b2Lost-time accidents: where an injury is sustained and the injured party is unable to return to work on the day following the \naccident. A seven day lost-time accident classification is also used to reflect a higher degree of severity, such that the injured \nparty is unable to return to their normal duties within seven days of suffering the injury.\nThe following provides an update of Health & Safety  items of note during 2022:\n\t\u25b2There were no severe accidents across the portfolio during the year. However, the Lost Time Accident Frequency Rate increased \ncompared to 2021, in part reflecting improved reporting, as well as a larger construction portfolio and higher offshore activity, with \nactions taken to avoid recurrence in the case of each incident.\n\t\u25b2The increased number of incidents is in part reflected by the increased construction activity in the portfolio with manual handling \nincidents (associated with the installation of the solar panels) seen at the Cadiz solar construction sites, where there were up to \n400 people across the four sites at certain  time s. There were also several incidents reported at the Merkur offshore site, where \nthere was a high level of activity associated with the rectification of the rear frame issue.\n\t\u25b2The quality  of Health & Safety  reporting remains high across most of the portfolio, with good transparency and follow up of \nincidents. There has been an increased focus on positive leading indicators such as the number of independent and internal \nsafety audits or reviews, hazard identifications and safety walks.\n\t\u25b2Approval was given to install improved welfare facilities across the GB Solar sites in 2023.\n\t\u25b2In addition, further safety equipment within the turbine towers of some of the older GB onshore wind farms will be installed in \n2023.\n\t\u25b2RES is a Tier 1 member of SafetyOn and sits on the SafetyOn Management Board. RES\u2019s TRIG Operations Management team \nattended a collaboration event in November which served as a great opportunity for owners and subcontractors to share their \nthoughts on key safety issues. In the same vein, RES continues to regularly hold its own Health & Safety  coordination group to \nfoster relationships between the various asset managers across the TRIG portfolio, share information and discuss matters that \nhave occurred in the portfolio. This year it allowed those working on UK and German offshore sites to share their experiences, \nsomething  that they wouldn\u2019t normally get the opportunity to do.\nSection Number Heading 0",

development\nBy acquiring assets at an earlier stage in their development, TRIG seeks to access improved \nreturns and a wider investment opportunity set.  \nLocated in the Haute-Marne department in France, Vannier is \na 43MW onshore wind farm consisting of 17 Envision E-131 \n2.5MW turbines. Construction commenced in February 2020. \nConstruction was delivered under an EPC wrap by an Envision-\nVelocita consortium. \nFollowing permit issues at the site, for which full commercial \nprotection had been previously obtained, construction was \nresumed in September 2021, with full commercial takeover \nachieved in September 2022. \nLocated on the Kintyre Peninsula in Scotland, Blary Hill is a \n35MW onshore wind farm consisting of 14 Nordex 2.5MW \nturbines. Construction started in 2020 and the project was \ncompleted early in 2022. Construction was delivered by RES \nunder an EPC wrap, a management model in which a principal \ncontractor secures each of the supply contracts and has \ncontractual commitments to deliver the project on time and on \nbudget. A third-party technical adviser provided independent \noversight of key milestones. \nBoth the local community and the local environment have been \nconsidered throughout the construction process. Several local \ncompanies were engaged for construction work, with local \nemployment centres being utilised for the recruitment of labour \noperatives. Additionally, habitat management plans will be \nimplemented along with compensatory planting, to improve the \ncondition of the natural environment.BLARY HILL, SCOTLAND completed Q1 2022\nVANNIER, FRANCE completed Q3 2022Recently completed construction projectsThe delivery and de-risking of projects through construction \nand development enhances value for shareholders who benefit \nfrom the shift to a lower discount rate used to value operational \nprojects; and enable TRIG\u2019s Managers to deploy TRIG\u2019s balance \nsheet to create new low-carbon generation and flexible capacity \nto contribute to the decarbonisation of the electricity system and \nimprove energy security.\nImportantly, TRIG benefits from its Managers\u2019 expertise in \ninvesting in and delivering infrastructure projects through \nconstruction and development: InfraRed as a greenfield investor \nfor the past 25 years and RES as a developer and/or constructor \nof over 23GW and operator of over 10GW of renewable assets \nglobally.\nIn sourcing construction and development stage investments, \nInfraRed carefully screen s opportunities  to ensure they are \naligned with TRIG\u2019s portfolio construction strategy and are \nadditive to the portfolio as a whole. InfraRed, with input from RES, then perform due diligence  and structure each opportunity \nto ensure that risks are allocated to parties best positioned to \nmanage them and that the returns reflect the risks being borne \nby TRIG\u2019s portfolio company. Once an investment is brought into \nthe portfolio, RES, with input from InfraRed, actively oversee s \nconstruction and development activities to manage costs, \ntimetable, quality, contractor interface, transition into operations, \nstakeholder engagement and, importantly, health & safety.\nAt the balance sheet date, 8% of the portfolio by value was in \nconstruction and development. This represents the Ranasj\u00f6, \nSalsj\u00f6 and Gr\u00f6nhult wind farms in Sweden as well as the \ndevelopment premium for the four battery storage projects in \ndevelopment: Ryton, Drakelow, Drax and Spennymoor. Taking \nthe expected construction spend for the Ryton and Drakelow \nbatteries, which are expected to be contracted in 2023, would \nincrease the construction and development exposure to 11% of \nthe portfolio by value.\nSection Number Heading 0", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc706deb-a2bc-4267-88ed-519e9665577b": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc706deb-a2bc-4267-88ed-519e9665577b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "de8ed2bb-a8fd-4ebe-8176-b0ee47560626", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "cf7e0eaef801adef54bca973a50198b656d5e103ea049b98da1b4c7cc1432b02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d61c9d6b-c8af-400e-abbe-3a83a370a2e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "2f4232c2a731fc06524fe68a1d203826099ce7aa67ea5f3318df7a5cebdcf8fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "83ceb820-058b-4377-bc37-3e9b96343df0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "1b660e38f380ea5806a44b13841c4293cd66c5ad186122e08d1b40f409fcff31", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "052074f0eb84706f82a970810fe6bb93c9430efc62dffc87c3014f02c72518fc", "text": "Located in southwest Sweden, the 12 x Vestas \nV162 5.6MW (67.2MW) project was acquired from \nVattenfall in January 2021. \nVattenfall managed the construction to a high \nstandard under a multi-contract approach \nwith excellent health & safety performance. \nConstruction commenced in Q1 2021 with all \nturbines erected prior to the end of 2022 and early \ngeneration achieved in October 2022.

In order to develop a robust \nunderstanding of the Company\u2019s carbon footprint, current \nemissions and appropriate mitigation pathways, an established \nthird-party sustainability consultant was engaged to assist in \nthe collection and analysis of emissions data from each of our \nportfolio companies.\nDuring 2022, the Company collected and published Scope 1, \n2 and 3 emissions data for the entire portfolio. This establishes \na baseline to develop relevant targets in line with the \ncommitments of TRIG and its Managers. \nWe are currently engaging with the SBTi around the \ntarget -setting process to develop targets which appropriately \nreflect the Company\u2019s business of being a renewable energy \ngenerator and expect to submit and validate these during \n2023.

prices\nThroughout the last 12 months, spot and near-term forward power prices have remained elevated and volatile compared to historical \nlevels due to the impacts of electricity demand returning to pre-pandemic levels and severe disruption to the supply of natural gas to \nEurope. Over the period Russia reduced exports of gas to the region, including the indefinite shutdown of the Nord Stream gas pipeline \nin response to sanctions related to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. This led to an increase in power prices due to the link between gas \nprices and power prices in much of Europe. Compounding this was a strong recovery in demand for electricity from Covid-19-related \nlows of the two previous years.\nIn order to reduce dependence on Russian gas imports, European governments and institutions proactively intervened to increase \nenergy storage levels and reduce energy consumption, which combined with relatively mild weather during Q4 2022 has alleviated \nsome pressure on current and near-term forward power prices. \nHowever, power prices remain sensitive to demand and supply pressures (including weather and power plant outages) and are \nexpected to remain above historical levels for some years.\nGas storage levels compared to forward power prices in the EU\n0100200300400500600700\n0102030405060708090100\nPower Price (\u00a3/MWh )Gas Storage Levels (% )\n10-Year Rang e 10-Year Avg.

Diversification across the markets TRIG invests in helps \nreduce the exposure to local fluctuations. In addition to power \nmarket diversification, the Company also uses active power price \nmanagement to reduce risk.  The Company actively seeks to \nsecure favourable near -term forward power prices by selectively \nentering into fixes to reduce power price sensitivity, supplementing \nits longer-term fixed revenues per megawatt hour from government \nsubsidies.

responsible for carrying out the fair market valuation of the Group\u2019s investments, which is presented to the \nDirectors for their approval and adoption. A valuation is carried out on a six-monthly basis as at 30 June and 31 December each year. \nFor non-market traded investments (being all the investments in the current portfolio), the valuation is based on a discounted cash flow \nmethodology and accordance with IFRS 13 and IFRS 10, given the special nature of infrastructure investments. \nThe valuation for each investment in the portfolio is derived from the application of an appropriate discount rate to reflect the perceived \nrisk to the investment\u2019s future cash flows in order  to give the present value of those cash flows. The Investment Manager exercises its \njudgement in assessing the expected future cash flows from each investment based on the project\u2019s expected life and the financial \nmodel produced by each project entity. In determining the appropriate discount rate to apply to a given investment, the Investment \nManager takes into account the relative risks associated with the revenues, which include fixed price per MWh income (lower risk) \nor merchant power sales income (higher risk). Where a project has both income types a theoretical split of future receipts has been \napplied, with a different (higher) discount rate used for an investment\u2019s return deriving from the merchant income compared to the fixed \nprice income, equivalent to using an appropriate blended rate for the investment.\nThe Directors\u2019 Valuation of the portfolio as at 31 December 2022 was \u00a33,737.0m. This valuation compares to \u00a32,725.8m as at 31 \nDecember 2021 and \u00a33,235.6m as at 30 June 202256.\nValuation movements\nA breakdown of the movement in the Directors\u2019 valuation in the year is illustrated in the chart and set out in the table below .\nValuation movement in the year to 31 December 2022\n2,7263,1393,737694(280) 266(177) 234 73202\n\u00a3\u00a3500\u00a31,000\u00a31,500\u00a32,000\u00a32,500\u00a33,000\u00a33,500\u00a34,000\n31-Dec-21\nValuationNew\nInvestmentsCash\nDistributions\nfrom PortfolioRebased\nValuationChange in\nPower Price\nForecastMovement in\nDiscount\nRatesChange in\nIn\ufb02ation\nAssumptionForeign\nExchange\nMovement*Balance\nof Portfolio\nReturn31-Dec-22\nValuationPortfolio valuation (\u00a3m)\nNet of adverse impact of the \nUK Electricity Generator Levy \u2013 \n(\u00a3188)m\n*  Foreign exchange movement is stated before the offsetting effect of hedges which are held at the Company and subsidiary level.

The forecasts are materially up in \nthe short to medium te rm, but with the longer term broadly unchanged in real terms, resulting in an overall increase in valuation of the \nportfolio from a year ago by \u00a3453.8m. This is reduced by the impact of the UK Electricity Generator Levy (\u201cEGL\u201d) which is explained in \nmore detail below which leads to a net valuation increase arising from increase in power price forecasts after the impact of the UK EGL \nof \u00a3265.7m. This impact includes the long -term change in power curve inflation (see item (iv) changes to inflation assumptions ). \nOver the year, spot power prices and the short-to-medium term power price forecasts have markedly increased due to supply chain \nconstraints exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine and associated disruption to energy markets .

This includes coal as a stopgap measure (notwithstanding its high carbon tax). This transition has resulted in  \nwholesale power  price forecasts remaining elevated across the 2020s before reverting to the levels similar to those  being  forecast at the \nprevious year end as additional demand and supply are broadly expected to balance. Over the longer term this also includes electricity \ndisplacing gas usage  (for example switching to electric heating), introducing  the use of green hydrogen and including more intermittent \nrenewable generation and/or nuclear generation.\nPrior to the Ukraine conflict , near-term power prices across Europe were already elevated, mainly caused by increasing gas demand  \nduring 2021 and early 2022. Gas storage levels were low over the last winter period (2021/22) as electricity demand increased during \n2021 as economies came out of lockdown and electricity generated from other sources, such as wind and nuclear, was lower than \nusual ( due to unusually low wind levels and outages, respectively) . This  has led to  European gas prices, and hence electricity prices, \nbeing  more sensitive to reduced supply and/or increased demand.\nPower prices are one of the key risks faced by the Company: a number of factors go into power price forecasting to estimate electricity \ndemand, including the mix of generation technology meeting this demand and for each technology , their associated costs of supply. As \nsuch, it is inherently difficult to estimate and then apply these factors to accurately forecast the outcome of this dynamic market.

Whilst transaction evidence is not yet demonstrating a clear increase in discount rates, the yield of long-term government bonds \nhas increased since 30 June 2022.  The Investment Manager has applied an average increase of 0.5% to discount rates across the \nportfolio.  The valuation discount rates applied to investments in the UK have been increased by more than those in the EU, reflecting \nthe higher long-term government bond yields in the UK.

This effect has increased the portfolio weighted average discount rate by 0.1% since \nDecember 2021.\nDuring the year, the Company commissioned  an independent valuation of the portfolio and  unde rtook  a further review of the discount \nrates adopted for the December 2022 valuation, which confirmed that the rates used were reasonable .

After the impact of forward currency hedges held at Company level are taken \ninto account, the foreign exchange gain reduces to \u00a336.6m.\nEuro-denominated investments comprised 41% of the portfolio at the year end.\nThe Group enters into forward hedging contracts (selling euros, buying sterling) for an amount equivalent to its expected income from \neuro-denominated investments over the short term, currently approximately the next 48 months. In addition, the Group enters into \nfurther forward hedging contracts such that, when combined with the \u201cincome hedges\u201d, the overall level of hedge achieved in relation \nto the euro-denominated assets is typically in the range of 60% to 80% of their valuation.

Ranasj\u00f6, Salsj\u00f6, Gr\u00f6nhult and the Cadiz solar projects were under construction as at 31 December 2022. Due to contractual measures in place, TRIG does not \nretain any construction risk for the Cadiz solar projects, therefore they are included in the table under \u201cContracted to acquire\u201d. \n6.  This is the investment commitment to acquire the Spanish solar projects.\n7.  This investment is in the form of mezzanine-level bonds where the Company does not have an equity stake. The portfolio comprises five onshore wind farms in \nNorthern France with a combined capacity of 74MW and four operational solar parks with battery storage located on the islands of Corsica and La R\u00e9union with \na combined capacity of 29MW (\u201cthe Portfolio\u201d). All the Portfolio assets are backed by the French government\u2019s Feed-in Tariff subsidy and have an average year \nof commission of 2015.\n8.  In March 2022 the Company committed to invest in a 7.8% stake in Hornsea One which completed in July 2022. In July 2022 the Company committed to invest \nin a further 2.4% stake in Hornsea One which completed in October 2022.\n9. In December 2022 the Company completed the acquisition of an additional 11% stake in Merkur, increasing the Company\u2019s holding from 25% to 36%.\nSection Number Heading 0", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "157ee0cd-2052-4e79-99a4-deda12b7e945": {"__data__": {"id_": "157ee0cd-2052-4e79-99a4-deda12b7e945", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d4567e06-8e48-46e3-8877-4be5cd15a449", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "947da167c131d2447b4ebd3239c5b171bba4a1b56df539c5a05a0c724d6722c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "88625176-f3cd-47a8-89dd-f7e109762d7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "f469460d38bf412d7d09530068d5cbed5db9c87af8dcc3c9341e4443762523e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2506e575-d4ad-4f8f-b0c3-79e9b9747bca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "84ff8a718d7713348edaf6f89b527b634475046bd8f494ae959b88fa674b33a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "3aa12c453fb43bd8c8941407d7eef97a11d0f0df84618607fcd3317bc2adfdec", "text": "TRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022 673.2\nAnalysis of Financial Results  \nSECTION 3:\nPERFORMANCE & RISK\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group had investments in 90 projects. As an investment entity for IFRS reporting purposes, the Company \ncarries these investments at fair value. The results below are shown on a statutory and on an \u201cexpanded\u201d basis as we have done in \nprevious years. See the box below for further explanation.\nBasis of preparation\nIn accordance with IFRS 10, the Group carries investments at fair value as the Company meets the conditions of being an \nInvestment Entity. In addition, IFRS 10 states that investment entities should measure their subsidiaries that are themselves \ninvestment entities at fair value. Being investment entities, The Renewables Infrastructure Group (UK) Limited (\u201cTRIG UK\u201d) and \nThe\u00a0Renewables Infrastructure Group (UK) Investments Limited (\u201cTRIG UK I\u201d), the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, through which \ninvestments are purchased, are measured at fair value as opposed to being consolidated on a line-by-line basis, meaning their \ncash, debt and working capital balances are included as an aggregate number in the fair value of investments rather than the \nGroup\u2019s current assets. In order to provide shareholders with more transparency into the Group\u2019s capacity for investment, ability to \nmake distributions, operating costs and gearing levels, adjusted results have been reported in the pro forma tables below. \nThe pro forma tables that follow show the Group\u2019s results for the year ended 31 December 2022 and the prior year on a \nnon-statutory \u201cExpanded basis\u201d, where TRIG UK and TRIG UK I are consolidated on a line-by-line basis, compared to the Statutory \nIFRS financial statements (the \u201cStatutory IFRS basis\u201d).  The Directors have provided the non-statutory Expanded basis to assist \nusers of the accounts in understanding the performance and position of the Company, by including the cash and debt balances \ncarried in TRIG UK and TRIG UK I and expenses incurred in TRIG UK and TRIG UK I.\nThe necessary adjustments to get from the Statutory IFRS basis to the non-statutory Expanded basis are shown for the primary \nfinancial statements. The commentary provided on the primary statements of TRIG is on the Expanded Basis.\nIncome Statement\nThe Statutory IFRS basis does not \ninclude  TRIG\u00a0UK and TRIG UK I\u2019s \ncosts, such as  overheads, management \nfees and acquisition costs against \nincome. The\u00a0Expanded basis includes \nthe expenses incurred within TRIG\u00a0UK \nand TRIG UK I to enable users of \nthe accounts to fully understand the \nGroup\u2019s costs. There is no difference in \nprofit before tax or earnings per share \nbetween the two bases.Balance Sheet\nThe Statutory IFRS basis includes \nTRIG UK and TRIG UK I\u2019s cash, debt \nand working capital balances as part \nof portfolio value. The Expanded basis \nshows these balances gross. There is \nno difference in net assets between the \nStatutory IFRS basis and the Expanded \nbasis.\nThe majority of cash generated from \ninvestments had been passed up \nfrom TRIG UK and TRIG UK I to the \nCompany by 31 December 2022.\nAt 31 December 2022, TRIG UK I was \n\u00a3398.5m drawn on its revolving credit \nfacility (2021: \u00a372.8m drawn) being the \nmajority of the difference between the \nStatutory IFRS basis and the Expanded \nbasis.Cash Flow Statement\nThe Statutory basis shows cash \nmovements for the top company \nonly (TRIG Limited). The Expanded \nbasis shows the consolidated cash \nmovements above the investment \nportfolio which are relevant to users \nof the accounts. Differences include \nincome received by TRIG UK and \nTRIG UK I applied to reinvestment and \nexpenses incurred by TRIG UK and \nTRIG UK I that are excluded under the \nStatutory IFRS basis.\nThe purchase of investments on the \nExpanded basis is funded by both the \ncompany\u2019s revolving credit facility and \namounts passed down after capital \nraises. The remaining balance is that of \nreinvestment.\nSection Number Heading 0Analysis of Financial \nResults 3.2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2506e575-d4ad-4f8f-b0c3-79e9b9747bca": {"__data__": {"id_": "2506e575-d4ad-4f8f-b0c3-79e9b9747bca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00ed0dba-9263-4545-99bd-539dca71760b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "b96ade5f4f7d3f2afb47e8d6c2d9f12bff1f4a159be85e031a5b42d102a86b84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "157ee0cd-2052-4e79-99a4-deda12b7e945", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "3aa12c453fb43bd8c8941407d7eef97a11d0f0df84618607fcd3317bc2adfdec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3648f8a9-a9f1-45e2-bec3-4fee7450e3ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "a745f244592404357b0d4bbc9a784dca78f9ad0af59b6fb9211ff137824e37ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "84ff8a718d7713348edaf6f89b527b634475046bd8f494ae959b88fa674b33a8", "text": "68 TRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 20223.2\nAnalysis of Financial Results  (continued)\nIncome statement\nSummary income statement Year to 31 December 2022\n\u00a3\u2019millionYear to 31 December 2021\n\u00a3\u2019million\nStatutory  \nIFRS Basis Adjustments1Expanded \nBasisStatutory  \nIFRS Basis Adjustments1Expanded \nBasis\nOperating income 555.2 43.4 598.6 174.8 29.5 204.3\nAcquisition costs \u2013 (2.6)  (2.6)  \u2013 (1.9)  (1.9)  \nNet operating income 555.2 40.8 596.0 174.8 27.6 202.4\nFund expenses (2.3)  (27.1)   (29.4)   (1.9)  (21.9)   (23.8)   \nForeign exchange (loss)/gains (32.1)   (4.3)  (36.4)   37.6 0.0 37.6\nFinance costs (0.1)  (9.4)  (9.5)  (0.0)  (5.7)  (5.7)  \nProfit before tax 520.7 0.0 520.7 210.5 0.0 210.5\nEPS221.5p \u2013 21.5p 10.0p \u2013 10.0p\n1.

The income \nadjustment offsets these cost adjustments.\n2.  Calculated based on the weighted average number of shares during the year being approximately 2,424.0 million shares.\nAnalysis of Expanded Basis financial results\nProfit before tax for the year to 31 December 2022 was \u00a3520.7 million, generating earnings per share of 21.5p, which compares to \n\u00a3210.5 million and earnings per share of 10.0p for the year to 31 December 2021. \nThe EPS of 21.5p reflects high revenues generated in the year as a result of particularly high wholesale power prices coupled with \nhigher subsidies as a result of their indexation to inflation, and increases in the portfolio valuation (which is included in Operating Income) \nprimarily as a result of expectations for power prices and inflation continuing to be elevated over the short-medium term .\nOther areas contributing to valuation growth have been foreign exchange movements as sterling has weakened against the euro. \nThese increases are partially offset by the Electricity Generator Levy (EGL) introduced in the UK applied to actual revenues from the sale \nof electricity in excess of the threshold schemes and other government intervention schemes (clawback and caps) across the other \nmarkets. The valuation discount rate has also been increased in the year with the portfolio discount rate increasing to 7.2% (2021: \n6.6%) reflecting increasing long-term government borrowing rates . This also had the effect of reducing the overall valuation.  The factors \ncausing the movement in the valuation are more fully described in Section 3.1 \u2013 Valuation of the Portfolio.\nGeneration volume in the year was below budget, although this was more than offset by the higher-than-budgeted power prices \nachieved during the year.\nAcquisition costs of \u00a32.6m (202 1: \u00a31.9m) relate to the investments in the year, mostly attributable to the investments in Hornsea One, \nValdesolar, Spennymoor, Ryton, Drakelow and Drax battery storage projects as well as the incremental investment in  Merkur. \nYear to  \n31 December \n2022\n(\u00a3\u2019million)Year to  \n 31 December \n2021\n(\u00a3\u2019million)\nAcquisition costs 2.6 1.9\nTotal acquisition commitments made in the year 648.1 677.9\nAcquisition costs as % of investments 0.4% 0.3%\nAn increase in fund expenses in the year to 31 December 2022 as compared to the year to 31 December 2021 reflects the increase in \nthe size of the portfolio. \nSection Number Heading 0", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3648f8a9-a9f1-45e2-bec3-4fee7450e3ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "3648f8a9-a9f1-45e2-bec3-4fee7450e3ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c36314c1-c337-4d37-b76c-9a4fe13ee232", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "e8251bd15603c08fead9f3b216a19f0505d07e6dbe36efd242bddbffb673030b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2506e575-d4ad-4f8f-b0c3-79e9b9747bca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "84ff8a718d7713348edaf6f89b527b634475046bd8f494ae959b88fa674b33a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "47eb6584-f95f-4fd0-badf-b30e8208e5e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "01948137bf0dd4f317f0ce57bb4317ecc461f532bd9309fca2098c0af5ed32c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a745f244592404357b0d4bbc9a784dca78f9ad0af59b6fb9211ff137824e37ee", "text": "TRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022 69\nSECTION 3:\nPERFORMANCE & RISKFund expenses of \u00a329.4 million (2021: \u00a323.8 million) includes all operating expenses and \u00a326.6 million (2021: \u00a321.5 million) in fees \npaid to the Investment and Operations Managers.

The facility expiry date is 31 December 2025 with options to extend for up to an additional \n24 months. Margins on the facility when drawn are 1.85%  over the relevant reference rate. T he facility can be drawn in sterling or euros.\nThe revolving credit facility enables the Group to fund new acquisitions and to provide letters of credit should they be required. The \nfacility includes a \u00a345m working capital element.\nThe short-term financing provided by the revolving credit facility is limited to 30% of the portfolio value. It is intended that any drawings \nused to finance acquisitions are repaid, in normal market conditions, within a year through equity fundraisings.\nThe credit  facility was drawn at the commencement of the year having funded investments in 2021 and was subsequently repaid \nfollowing the capital raising in March 2022. During the second half of the year further new investments were funded in addition to \nproviding funding to the Spanish solar projects and Swedish wind projects the Group has in construction. The balance at the year end \nis \u00a3399m. \nIn addition to the revolving credit  facility, the projects may have underlying project-level debt. There is an additional gearing limit in \nrespect of such debt, which is typically non-recourse to TRIG, of 50% of the Gross Portfolio Value (being the total enterprise value of \nsuch portfolio companies), measured at the time the debt is drawn down or acquired as part of an investment. The Company may, in \norder to secure advantageous borrowing terms, secure a project finance facility over a group of portfolio companies.\nThe project-level gearing at 31 December 2022 across the portfolio was 3 8% (2021: 40%). Principal repayments in the year totalled \n\u00a3174m, as the debt is retired over the project\u2019s subsidy periods. Gearing has reduced during 2022 partially due to the scheduled \nrepayment of debt in the year and partially due to the mix of acquisitions in the year, some of which introduced new debt in projects and \nsome of which were acquired without project debt.  \nThe vast majority of the project debt is fixed and has an average cost of 3.6% (including margin). The project -level debt is fully \namortising and repaid in each case over the period of the subsidy term. The portfolio weighted average subsidy life remaining is \n11\u00a0years.\nForeign Exchange Hedging\nAt the year end, 41% of the portfolio was located within France, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden63, Germany and Spain and hence is \ninvested in euro-denominated assets. \nThe Group enters into forward hedging contracts against expected income from the euro-denominated investments\u2019 distributions up \nto four years ahead.

Management\nThe Company has a risk management framework in place \ncovering all aspects of the Group\u2019s business. Given the nature \nof the Company (being an Investment Company where the \nCompany outsources key services to the Investment Manager, \nOperations Manager and other service providers), reliance \nis placed on the Group service providers\u2019 own systems and \ncontrols. The identification, assessment and management of \nrisk are integral elements of the Investment Manager\u2019s and \nthe Operations Manager\u2019s work in both managing the existing \nportfolio and in transacting new investment opportunities. \nThe Managers and Board discuss and consider what emerging \nrisks there are to the Company at the board meetings. The \nCompany has a range of advisers in addition to its Managers. \nThese advisers report on key topics and potential events which \nmay present potential risks that the Board and the Manager \nneed to monitor and, where possible, mitigate. In addition, \nthe Company and its Managers are registered with various \nindustry bodies which alert both the Board and the Managers of \nemerging risks as key events and news items unfold.\nThe inherent risk of each existing and emerging risk is assessed \nbased on their likelihood of occurring and their potential impact \nshould they manifest. Where necessary and possible, mitigation \nplans are developed to reduce the residual risk.\nThe Managers utilise their systems, their policies, oversight of \nthe supply chain and third-party input to manage these risks. \nThe strength of mitigants and controls is applied to the inherent \nrisk to determine the residual risk, which is classified as \u2018high\u2019, \n\u2018medium\u2019, \u2018low\u2019 or \u2018insignificant\u2019. If a new risk arises or the \nlikelihood of a risk occurring increases, a mitigation strategy \nis, where appropriate, developed and implemented together \nwith enhanced monitoring by the Investment Manager and/or \nOperations Manager. The Managers review and consider the \nGroup\u2019s key and emerging risks with the Board on a quarterly basis. Given the stability of the Company\u2019s investment policy \nand focus of its strategy (i.e. investments in renewable energy \ninfrastructure projects in the UK or Europe), the risks in the Group \nare not expected to change materially from quarter to quarter.\nThe Board\u2019s Management Engagement Committee also reviews \nthe performance of the Investment Manager and Operations \nManager (as well as all key service providers) annually, which \nincludes a consideration of the Managers\u2019 internal controls and \ntheir effectiveness and the maintenance of a risk control matrix.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe Board and the Managers have considered and reviewed the \nCompany\u2019s key risks. Risks relating to the Covid-19 pandemic \n(health and safety, energy yield, political and regulatory and \ntaxation risks, as explained on page 77 of TRIG\u2019s Annual Report \nand Financial statements 2021) and risks relating to the UK\u2019s exit \nfrom the EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d) (political / regulatory and electricity pricing, \nas explained on page 77 of TRIG\u2019s Annual Report and Financial \nstatements 2021) have reduced during the year. However, the \nexceptionally high levels of energy prices and persistently high \nlevels of inflation across the markets the Company invests in \nmeans that the increase in regulatory and political risk last \nyear was borne out during the year.

\nCounterparty exposure may arise from:\n\u2022 Given the importance of government-supported revenues \nfor many investments in renewables, TRIG has exposure \nto the creditworthiness of and policy commitments by \nnational governments and is reliant on the consistency of \ngovernment policy. One example is the \u201cgrandfathering\u201d \nwithin the UK whereby renewables generators continue to \nreceive the same level of revenue per MWh generated, set \nupon commissioning, for the duration of the incentive. \n\u2022 In addition, each project company enters into a \ncommercial PPA with a utility or energy trading company to \nenable them to sell the electricity generated and to receive \nthe FiT or ROC subsidy payments. The project companies \nhave entered into PPAs with a range of providers. \n\u2022 Each project company enters into a contract for the \nmaintenance of the plant. This is often, but not always, with \nthe original equipment manufacturer; in recent years there \nhas been an increase in the number of alternative providers \nin an expanding renewables equipment maintenance \nmarket. \n\u2022 There are also contracts with equipment and/or EPC \nproviders who may be building or maintaining plant and/or \nhave defect guarantees for past works. For both wind and \nsolar sectors, projects may also benefit from equipment \nprovider warranties. Failure of any of these counterparties \nrepresents a risk for the group.\nThe chart below provides an analysis of the exposure to PPA \ncounterparties, as well as the equipment and maintenance \nproviders, as measured against the portfolio valuation and against \nthe number of projects in which the counterparty is involved.\nThere are significant exposures to counterparties, in particular: \n\u2022 Statkraft, Orsted and Scottish Power (as PPA providers to \nprojects totalling over 10% of the portfolio by value), and \n\u2022 Vestas, Siemens, Orsted and RES (as equipment and \nmaintenance providers to projects totalling over 10% of the \nportfolio by value).\nIn the event that a counterparty or guarantor enters insolvency, \n1 Power Purchase Agreement\n2 Feed-in Tariff\n3 Renewable Obligation CertificatesExposure to equipment manufacturers shown on an \ninvested portfolio valuation basis\n\u25b2 Siemens  46%\n\u25b2 Vestas  23%\n\u25b2 GE  8%\n\u25b2 Trina Solar  6%\n\u25b2 Nordex  4%\n\u25b2 JA Solar  3%\n\u25b2 Renesolar  2%\n\u25b2 Envision  2%\n\u25b2 Other  6%then there is a risk of disruption while counterparties are \nreplaced and a risk of distribution lock-up for the assets \nthat are project-financed. For equipment manufacturers, the \nCompany has the greatest exposures to Siemens and Vestas. \nIf the associated contracts are priced below market levels, \nreplacement of a counterparty may result in increases in costs to \nthe affected portfolio companies. As a result, benchmarking of \ncosts is an important part of pre-investment due diligence.\nTurbine suppliers are financially under pressure as they seek to \nfulfil largely fixed price supply contracts whilst being exposed to \nvariable input costs. These input costs are exposed to inflation, \nparticularly relating to materials, transportation and energy. \nWhilst TRIG\u2019s greatest exposures are to Siemens and Vestas, \nthe largest turbine suppliers in Europe, the Company does use \na wide range of suppliers to help mitigate concentration risk. A \nnumber of turbine manufacturers are resetting the pricing of new \nturbines upwards, which may feed into more stable financials \nover two to three years as they work through their order \nbooks. Further, the fundamentals behind the industry, policies \nsupporting wind energy globally, remain in place and we believe \nthat although certain turbine suppliers may be facing difficulty, \nthe risk of systemic failure is not high. \nRecent elevated wholesale power prices may present challenges \nto retail electricity suppliers with unhedged positions, some of \nwhom may also be PPA providers to the Group. The Company \nregularly monitors the credit worthiness of all PPA counterparties \nand has not identified any significant financial issues with any of \nthe Group\u2019s PPA providers.\nSome project companies have more than one counterparty in \neach category \u2013 where that is the case, the relative valuation \nof the associated project in the illustration below has been \napportioned between counterparties. \nSection Number Heading 03.4 (continued)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3cd0324-59e5-4d84-8e5a-1edeaac8b945": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3cd0324-59e5-4d84-8e5a-1edeaac8b945", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e528c24e-528b-4ef7-88a7-54f650e961e5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "81", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "8b083bafa4cf34814fa56bb2c411b9caf67b794b049c1c7105d5d3fccb819cc8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "604e8c70-5d66-452c-aa05-052e5b59a0c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "c08609f85352c621c13e410a7593b5d3dcfe7b0667278c10d1d20d53fb44a878", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff48be8e-7a73-411c-b206-1f968d9591fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "c1256bc0c52010fe115136719ecf0daa8f8ef5bf29a9578c7de8a9872536041a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a8d33594b873eec72c5c736fa87f8c3b563dae5a57be489ed24b32fab5dbd641", "text": "TRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022 81\nSECTION 3:\nPERFORMANCE & RISKIllustration of the range of PPA counterparties, equipment manufacturers and maintenance suppliers as at \n31\u00a0December 2022 by relative value of associated projects 1 and number of projects: \n8\n2\n5\n1\n410\n22111341331911641111 1100013\n8\n2\n24\n62\n4\n311\n11119110\n0%10%20%30%\nCurrent Period Prior PeriodElectricity off-takers (PPA) Equipment maintenance  provider (O&M/OEM)\nStatkraftOrsted\nScottish PowerEWE\nHolaluz-Clidom S.A.SSE\nLimejump Energy Ltd\nVattenfall Energy TradingDanske Commodities\nRepsol Servicios Renovables SAUVattenfall ABEneco\nGazel EnergiesErova Energy LtdNpowerTotal FlexEDF\nViridianEquinor\nAxpo UK LimitedBritish Gas TradingEngie\nEDG AgregioPower NISmartest\nElectrorouteTotal\nTotal Gas and Power Shell Energy EuropeEON\nElectricity Supply BoardVestasSiemensOrstedRES\nNatural Power ServicesGE\nStatkraft Nordex\nSacyr Industrial S.L.U.EquinorEnercon VelocitaEnvisionAkuo\nDeutsche Windtecknik\nAustral Energy MaintenanceSolar Century\n1.

These risks are included amongst other risks faced by the Group in Section 3.4 \u2013 Risks and Risk \nManagement.\nAs part of being a self-managed Alternative Investment Fund, the Directors, together with the Managers, rigorously assess the risks \nfacing the Group and consider sensitivity analysis against the principal risks identified.\nThe Directors have determined that the five-year period to December 2027 is an appropriate period over which to provide this viability \nstatement as this period accords with the Group\u2019s business planning exercises and is appropriate for the investments owned by the \nGroup. The Group\u2019s risk management processes (described in Section 3.4  \u2013 Risks and Risk Management) consider the key risks during \nthis five-year period and beyond. These include sustainability-related risks that take into account environmental, social and governance \nconsiderations, one of which is climate change (in line with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial \nDisclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d)).\nTRIG is the owner of a portfolio of project companies whose underlying assets are predominately fully constructed and operating \nrenewable electricity generating facilities with economic lives significantly  in excess of the period being considered. As a result, TRIG \nbenefits from resilient,  long -term cash flows and a set of risks that can be identified and assessed , noting that from time  to time, risks \nmay manifest that have not been anticipated . Over the next five years, 60% of portfolio revenues are fixed per MWh under government \nsubsidies and fixed price PPAs  assuming expected generation levels . Forecast revenues for wholesale power prices are based upon \nindependent forecasts. The projects are each supported by detailed financial models. The Directors believe that diversification within the \nportfolio of projects (including but not limited to technologies, geographies and counterparties) helps to withstand and mitigate for risks \nit is most likely to meet.\nThe Investment Manager prepares and considers, and the Directors review, summary five-year cash flow projections each year which \nare refreshed quarterly as part of management reporting, business planning and dividend approval processes. The projections consider \ncash balances  and liquidity , key covenants and limits, dividend cover, investment policy compliance and other key financial indicators \nover the five-year period. Sensitivity analysis considers the potential impact of the Group\u2019s principal risks occurring (individually and \ntogether).

Where the investments have long -term debt \nfinancing in place , repayments of principal debt are  substantially covered by projected revenues arising from subsidies and other fixed \nprice income (per unit of power generated). This assumes normal levels of generation. It is expected that government subsid ies will \ncontinue to be in place and in cases where these have been amended or withdrawn in the past , these have tended to be isolated or \nspecific cases. \nWithdrawal of specifi c subsidy income from retroactive government action , should it manifest,  may threaten the solvency of individual \nprojects. The investments with senior debt in place are typically non-recourse to the Company and so should these projects become \nloss-making , the Company would not have an obligation to fund these.\nThe Company has considered an extreme downside case to be assuming significantly lower achieved power prices (at about half the \nlevel currently forecast ). Due to the low operating costs and that the long -term fixed rate project -level debt is expected to be covered by \nthe subsidy streams that would continue to be paid , this scenario showed the investments continued to be solvent and able to pass up \ndistributions to the Company. The cash available to the company to pay dividends and to reinvest would be reduced significantly such \nthat if dividends were not reduced , the dividend coverage would reduce to c . 1x and hence the current level of dividend might not be \nsustained.  However , dividends are discretionary and hence solvency and resilience in this scenario are maintained. \nThe Company takes an average of three power price forecasters \u2019 central cases to include in its valuation to estimate future market \nprices. Forecasters include both high and low cases in their forecasts. A reduction of power prices by half is below the forecasters \u2019 low \ncase scenarios. The probability attached to power prices being lower than the forecasters \u2019 low case s would typically be estimated by \nforecasters to be below 10% , suggesting this would be an unlikely  downside case. \nLess severe downside cases were run assuming 10% lower power price projections compared to the central case, reduced generation \nlevels assuming a P90 case (see Note 4 in the Financial Statements) and a combination of these scenarios were assessed. In all \nscenarios including the combined downside case , the company remained solvent and could continue to pay dividends  at current levels .  \nTRIG has a revolving credit facility (\u201cRCF\u201d) at fund level  which  was increased and extended to \u00a3750m on 3 \u00a0February 2023. This facility \nhas a three -year term and expires on 31 December 2025. The company uses the proceeds from equity fund raises to repay the RCF \nas well as operational cash from investments. Projected reinvestment flows over the next five years continue to be healthy  (\u00a388m of \nreinvestment was achieved in 202265). In the event that equity fund raises and reinvestment are not sufficient to repay the RCF balance \nby the expiry date , the Company would anticipate either renewing the RCF and/or raising new debt to repay that balance secured \nagainst ungeared projects within the portfolio (that represent 37% of the portfolio by value) and/or strategic disposals or a combination \nof all three activities.\n63% by value of the renewable energy projects TRIG owns have long -term, fixed -rate, amortising senior debt in place. These projects \ndo not need to be refinanced and the debt within these projects is scheduled to be repaid , in the main , from expected revenues arising \nfrom subsidies and fixed -price PPAs over the term of that fixed -price -per-MWh income.  37% by value of the renewable energy projects \nTRIG owns are ungeared.\nThe Company\u2019s dividend policy is to increase the dividend when the Board considers it prudent to do so, considering forecast cash \nflows, expected dividend cover, inflation across TRIG\u2019s key markets, the outlook for electricity prices and the operational performance of \nthe Company\u2019s portfolio.

The Board has overall responsibility for the oversight of TRIG\u2019s sustainability risks and \nopportunities, of which climate change is an important subset. As is set out in TRIG\u2019s Sustainability \nPolicy, which is available on TRIG\u2019s website. The TRIG Board ha s extensive experience in \nthe renewables sector, as shown in Section 4.1 \u2013 Board of Directors, and receive training on \nsustainability and ESG, to facilitate further understanding of the climate risks and opportunities \nfaced by the Company. The Board and Managers discuss risks related to climate change at \nleast annually and have ultimate oversight of the Company\u2019s risk management framework. \nConsideration of the transition risks and physical consequences of climate change features in \nthe Board\u2019s discussions. Climate change is also considered within the Company\u2019s risk register \nat each Board meeting.  The Board considers climate-related events through its discussions with \nthe Managers, notably in respect of opportunities through the Company\u2019s annual strategy reviews \nand risks through the Company\u2019s risk management framework which is presented in Section 3.4 \u2013 \nRisks and Risk management, on page 75. The Board\u2019s Audit Committee considers the Company\u2019s \nclimate-related disclosures, and the Board\u2019s Management Engagement Committee reviews the \nManagers\u2019 performance annually, including their adherence to the Company\u2019s Sustainability Policy.\n2Describe \nmanagement\u2019s role \nin assessing and \nmanaging climate-\nrelated risks and \nopportunitiesTRIG\u2019s Sustainability Policy, including climate change considerations, applies to both making \nnew investments (throughout the deal screening and due diligence processes) and running of the \ncurrent portfolio (asset management activities, monitoring and reporting). Day-to-day management \nof TRIG\u2019s portfolio is delegated to its Investment Manager, InfraRed, and its Operations Manager, \nRES. Detail on both organisations, including their commitments to addressing climate change can \nbe found in Section 2.1, on page 18, and throughout Section 2.4. The Managers monitor climate-\nrelated government policy, engaging with policy makers where appropriate, and physical changes \nin the climate, to inform the application of TRIG\u2019s strategy and the Managers\u2019 assessment of the \nrisks faced by the Company. Quarterly, TRIG\u2019s Advisory Committee, comprised of representatives \nfrom both Managers, considers TRIG\u2019s strategy and risks, the output of which is reported to and \ndiscussed with the Board.  \nInfraRed and RES each report on their sustainability-related activities, including relating to \nclimate change. Their reporting is available on their respective websites. RES and/or InfraRed are \nrepresented on the board of each project company. Through this role, they ensure that climate \nchange-related risks are considered by project company management teams and reflected in \nproject company risk registers.

The \nCompany defines short term as 5 years from the date of this report aligning with the Company\u2019s \nviability statement, medium term as 15 years from the date of this report, aligning to the typical \nlength of government-backed revenue support mechanisms, and long term as 30 years from the \ndate of this report, aligning with the typical life of a renewables infrastructure asset.  The pace of the \ntransition to a net zero carbon future will dictate the size of the investment opportunity for TRIG. \nUnder current plans for renewables deployment spread over the range of European countries in \nwhich TRIG invests, coupled with the expected need for the replacement of existing installations \nin due course, as well as supporting infrastructure, the Managers expect there to be significant \ninvestment opportunities for the Company over the long term. This is further expanded upon in \nresponse to recommendation four. Notwithstanding this, TRIG recognises that risks relating to \nclimate change could have an impact on the Company.

An increase in renewables build-out \nambition without sufficient demand-side action can reduce \npower price forecasts. \nIn the medium and longer term there is a risk that \ndevelopments in renewables and other clean generation \ntechnologies result in unforeseen changes in wholesale \npower prices, due to either changes in the marginal \ncost of generation which sets prices or policy changes \nto the system for setting prices. This is reflected in the \nCompany\u2019s principal risk reporting in Section 3.4 \u2013 Risks \nand Risk Management.\nClimate change means that portfolio investments will likely \nbe exposed to more frequent extreme weather events \nover time, particularly those in countries most affected by \nclimate risk, increasing the risk of physical damage to on-\nsite infrastructure and off-site transmission and distribution \nsystems, alongside additional safety risks and operational \nconsiderations.

This \nhas resulted in significant growth in markets \nwhere TRIG has an investment focus. In the \nnear term, the greatest investment activity in \nTRIG\u2019s key markets is expected to be from \nsubsidised offshore wind in the North Sea and \nonshore wind in France, and unsubsidised \nonshore wind in the UK and Nordics and solar \nin Iberia.\nThe geographies and technologies within \nthe portfolio are likely to increase as the \nInvestment Manager, InfraRed, also considers \na broader range of investment opportunities \nwithin the Company\u2019s investment remit.  \nThe development of renewables frameworks \nacross Europe (if they are considered to be \ncredible, stable and robust) could result in \nbroadening TRIG\u2019s diversification to further \ngeographies.\nAs newer storage technologies mature, \ninvestment opportunities may arise in such \nprojects. This may include the production \nand storage of \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen and its \nsubsequent use to replace otherwise difficult-\nto-abate energy users.Economics are pushing projects to greater scale, which \nmay result in fewer opportunities by number. This, coupled \nwith an increasing volume of capital looking to deploy into \nsustainable investment themes, means that renewable \nenergy projects can be highly sought after, and investment \ndiscipline is key. \u201cOff-market\u201d transactions sourced by the \nInvestment Manager, InfraRed, remain an important route \nto attractive opportunities.\nIn the long term, as portfolios mature and subsidy periods \ncome to an end, the power price exposure of renewable \ninvestment portfolios will naturally increase. The risks \nassociated with power price exposure of projects within \na merchant power price structure may be mitigated in \npart through offtake agreements or hedging instruments. \nFurther analysis of the potential transitional impact of \nclimate change on power prices is presented in the \nscenario analysis relating to recommendation five.\nFinancial \nplanningThe strength of the renewables investment \ntheme is underpinned by both its strong ESG \ncredentials, including the positive impact \non climate change, and investors\u2019 desire for \nlong-term sustainable income. This provides \nthe opportunity for TRIG to continue to grow. \nFor existing shareholders, this means greater \ndiversification through further acquisitions, \nincreased economies of scale, and accretion \nthrough raising capital at a share price in \nexcess of the Company\u2019s net asset value per \nshare.  \nTRIG\u2019s revolving credit facility and hedging \narrangements are ESG-linked. This provides \nthe opportunity to reduce the margin and \ncommitment fees under the facility should \nTRIG meet certain targets, including increasing \nthe number of homes powered by clean \nenergy from TRIG\u2019s portfolio.Increasing penetration of intermittent renewable electricity \ngenerators in the energy system risks increasing the \nvolatility in the prevailing and forecast power price. \nIn the near term, exposure is reduced through managing \nthe proportion of revenues with fixed power prices, \nachieved through the acquisition of investments with \nsubsidised revenues, fixing under offtake agreements and \nthe use of hedging instruments.\nForecasted revenues are budgeted based on estimates of \nenergy yield from individual projects.

This \nassessment covers the whole of TRIG\u2019s portfolio and considers \nthe physical impacts over the short, medium and long-term \nperiods based on different climate scenarios.\nCurrent long-term power price forecasts do not assume that \nclimate change is limited to 1.5-2 degrees and also do not \ncorrespond with a 4-degree temperature change scenario (as \nreferenced in the next TCFD consideration, the high physical risk \nscenario). \nTherefore, to assess the potential impact from climate change \non power prices, net zero versions of power price forecasters \nwere used across TRIG\u2019s portfolio to estimate the impact of a \nhigh transition risk scenario on TRIG\u2019s portfolio. Similarly for the \nhigher physical risk scenario, the current energy mix is assumed \nto stay static as this is estimated to equate to a 4-degree \ntemperature change \u2013 all else being equal. \nIt is important to note that these forecasts are incredibly \ncomplex, with a very large number of inputs that could be adjusted differently to arrive at either a high transition risk \nscenario or a high physical risk scenario. These scenarios \ncould be arrived at through a number of different paths. It is \nnot necessarily the case, for instance, that in a high transition \nrisk scenario that forecast power prices may be lower; greater \nthan expected demand, public policy or a market \u201cpremium\u201d on \nrenewable electricity could result in power prices at a higher level \nthan those we assume in the high transition risk scenario. \nEqually, it is not necessarily the case that in the high physical \nrisk scenario that power prices would increase relative to a high \ntransition risk scenario; for instance, electricity demand and \ncommodity prices may be lower than forecast. \nEstimates are provided below of the potential financial impact of \ntwo climate change scenarios. Neither of the two scenarios are \nconsidered as representing an indication of current fair value for \nthe portfolio, as the assumptions applied are for more extreme \nclimate scenarios. Nor do these scenarios reflect reasonably \npossible changes to the fair value in the next 12 months, and so \nare not included in the sensitivities included within note 4 to the \nfinancial statements.\nUnder this scenario, we assume that policy measures \nare put in place that accelerate the decarbonisation of \nenergy production, including higher than expected levels \nof renewables deployment, and each country where TRIG \ninvests achieving net-zero carbon by 2050.\nPhysical risks from extreme weather events are less frequent \nand effective insurance coverage remains generally available. \nIn a high transition risk scenario:\n \u25b2There is downward pressure on forecast power prices for \nrenewables generators due to greater decarbonisation \nof the energy mix from that assumed in the independent \npower price forecasts used in the Company\u2019s valuation.\n \u25b2This is, in part, offset by an increase in electricity demand \nas in transport, industry and heating as these sectors \nmove away from fossil fuels.\n \u25b2An increase in carbon prices is expected; however, this is \nlikely to be offset by lower gas prices and greater periods \nof time when non-emitting generation is setting the \nprevailing power price.  \n Although these scenarios are very difficult to quantify, in-\nhouse financial modelling undertaken using information from \nsite questionnaires in combination with climate projections \nas per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report suggests a possible impact \nof this scenario being an approximate 6% reduction in the \nPortfolio Value on a committed basis, or approximately 7p per \nshare. This impact could be reduced as a result of industry \nefficiencies, such as lower operating costs arising from \ngreater competition between sub-contractors as the sector \ncontinues to scale up, or increased generation efficiencies \nand performance. \nOne of the challenges to achieving more renewables build-out \nthan assumed in current power price forecasts, and therefore \ndecarbonisation, is that as long-term power prices fall, a \nfeedback loop of making fewer new projects financially viable \nis created, which in turn reduces the rollout rate and therefore \nreduces the downward

climate change scenario occurring across the \nlives of the assets currently in the portfolio that results in \na temperature change of greater than 3 degrees Celsius, \nresulting in extreme weather events that could threaten the \nsuccessful operation of assets within the portfolio. \nWe assume that under this scenario, renewables build-out \nlags expectations, the energy system is not decarbonised to \nan extent consistent with a lower impact from climate change \nand that insurance for damages may become unavailable or \nvery expensive. It is expected that these events could occur \nover an 5 \u201315-year time period.\nWhilst current power price forecasts are not prepared on \nthe basis of an overall temperature change, the underlying \nassumptions, particularly relating to renewables build-out, are \nconsistent with a 3 degree Celsius scenario.  \nThe Managers have undertaken in-house analysis, using the \nsame approach as that of the high transition risk analysis, to \nconsider the potential physical impact of climate change on \nTRIG\u2019s portfolio over a variety of scenarios . \nChronic changes refer to long-term and structural physical \nrisks. Acute changes refer to the increased risk of specific, \nextreme short-term events. How events are categorised under \nthese two headings is set out in the subsequent table.\nThe review suggests a possible adverse impact of physical \nrisks in a high temperature change scenario of c. \u00a02p to 3p  \nper share. The estimated financial impact does not consider \nthe offsetting impact of any insurance claims that may be \npossible.\nIn such a scenario, it is likely that the renewables rollout \nassumptions incorporated in current power price forecasts \nare unlikely to be met. Therefore, the Investment Manager considers that the medium to longer-term reductions seen \nin the power price forecasts in recent reporting periods may \nreverse and that there may be limited overall net impact on \nNAV. The estimated financial impacts are based on current \nviews, which are likely to evolve as industry methods mature.\nA key mitigant to the portfolio as a whole suffering from \na material event at any one asset is the portfolio\u2019s asset \ndiversification including the geographic spread across six \nEuropean countries, which helps to reduce the impact of \nlocalised weather events. \nSustainability considerations, including those relating \nto climate change, are integrated throughout InfraRed\u2019s \ninvestment process, for example a climate change risk \nassessment must be completed for all new investments. \nScenario and sensitivity analysis is also undertaken as part \nof due diligence and examined by the Investment Committee \nwhen considering investment approval.\nThe Managers have also undertaken analysis to consider \nthe impact on long-term power price forecasts of a 4 degree \ntemperature change scenario. In such a scenario, it is likely \nthat the renewables rollout assumptions incorporated in \ncurrent power price forecasts are unlikely to be met. The \ncurrent energy mix across Europe broadly equates to a 4 \ndegree temperature change and therefore the current power \nprice assumptions from 2024 (upon normalisation of forecast \npower prices from current elevated levels) is applied across \nthe forecast period as an approximation. \nThis, net of the impact of the physical risk assessment, \nresults in an increase in Portfolio Value on a committed basis \nby approximately 4% or approximately 6p per share.

Dry peat can also have a higher \nexposure risk to fire. \u25b2Some habitat management plans include \nmaintained firebreaks in accordance with \nsite risk assessments. \n \u25b2Monoculture forestry is removed from the \nimmediate vicinity of each wind turbine \nto provide sufficient space during turbine \nerection, which provides a degree of \nprotection from fire.\n \u25b2Some sites have wider forestry removal \nto improve energy yield performance \nwhich can be coupled with broadleaf \ncompensatory planting elsewhere.\nIcingExposure to icing changes as humidity \nlevels increase in those areas previously \nless affected by icing. Wind turbine blades \ncan be prone to ice build-up, impacting \naerodynamic performance or causing \nturbines to pause due to rotor imbalances, \nthereby increasing downtime. Ice throw \nfrom blades can also pose a safety risk, or \ncause damage to infrastructure. \u25b2Climatic conditions are considered during \nthe design phase to determine the extent \nof any icing impacts on yield as well as \nthe ice-throw risk (and potential throw \ndistance).\n \u25b2Turbines are set back from dwellings and \nroads minimising risk to people from ice \nthrow.\n \u25b2Turbines are available with anti-icing \nor de-icing systems.

The 2021 location-based emissions have been \nreinstated to reflect these revised emissions factors in order to compare on a like for like \nbasis. \nOverall, there has been a decrease in reported emissions from 2021 to 2022, which was \nlargely due to a reduction in the amount of energy purchased by the projects.  Other \ncontributing factors were an improvement in data collected from the underlying investments \nand a slight increase in projects which have green energy tariffs (72% to 75% as reported on \npage 40).\nHEAD_3rd line Section Number HEAD_2nd line", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5b04900-157b-4179-a3dc-492f2d9783d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5b04900-157b-4179-a3dc-492f2d9783d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e56a6394-f4b0-4848-b743-5dc182b0758a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "20a85bd876e4e520aed42563b456eba0520452d4b8fcc06c68a10aa80b1d64bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff14c73d-dfac-4f46-8015-29cf807c9347", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "728d420711fdac3d28c80d1d5cc3b15dbbd813ace935952c5dcabd373a6e4ec9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f012817-5054-47b2-a4d0-a2c03f6802ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "cddbb91acff4618e81ad8678f4cf025f20cfc82b4103ee1287656ec69eb39b20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ae683639c13159cd355a6a47a5ac48a14f65a7fe7d71119eeb4cceffdee246a5", "text": "TRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022 95\nSECTION 3:\nPERFORMANCE & RISK11Describe the targets \nused by the organisation \nto manage climate-\nrelated risks and \nopportunities and \nperformance against \ntargetsClimate-related targets are currently contained within the Company\u2019s RCF.

The Company also invests in infrastructure that supports the energy transition, including flexible capacity \nsuch as battery storage.\nThe Group aims to achieve portfolio diversification principally through investing across the European continent (including UK & Ireland) \nand a mix of renewable energy technologies, in order to improve the stability of shareholder returns by reducing risks of single asset \nconcentration, power markets, regulatory frameworks and local weather patterns. The Company\u2019s portfolio comprises onshore and \noffshore wind farms, solar farms and battery storage assets spread across the UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Sweden and Spain.\nTRIG\u2019s Investment Policy frames the Board\u2019s and the Managers\u2019 pursuit of the Company\u2019s objective. The key policies below provide \na summary of the parameters within which investments are made. The full wording of the Investment Policy can be found on the \nCompany\u2019s website at the following link: www.trig-ltd.com/about-us/why-invest-with-trig/business-model/investment-policy.\nKey investment policies\n\t\u25b2Investments are made in the UK and other European countries where the TRIG Board and Managers believe there is a stable \nrenewable energy framework.\n\t\u25b2Up to 65% of the Portfolio Value66 may be invested in projects that are located outside the UK.\n\t\u25b2Whilst investments are predominantly made in wind farms and solar projects, the Company may also invest in infrastructure that \nis complementary to renewables, such as flexible capacity, up to a limit of 20% of Portfolio Value.\n\t\u25b2Up to 25% of the Portfolio Value may be invested in development or construction projects (including repowering of existing \nassets).\n\t\u25b2In order to manage single asset concentration risk, no more than 20% of Portfolio Value may be invested in any single project.\n\t\u25b2Short-term debt (principally drawings on the Company\u2019s revolving credit  facility) is limited to 30% of the Portfolio Value.\n\t\u25b2Long-term debt (typically amortising project finance debt) is limited to 50% of the Gross Portfolio Value (being the total enterprise \nvalue of the Portfolio).\nHistorically, the Company has often made investments in 100% or majority equity ownership of assets. As renewable energy projects \nincrease in size, particularly in offshore wind, the Company is increasingly acquiring minority equity stakes. Where minority positions are \ntaken, the Investment Manager will secure TRIG\u2019s shareholder rights (including voting rights) through shareholder agreements and other \ntransaction documentation.\nOther policies covering revenue management, hedging, cash balances, the origination of further investments, repowering and material \namendments to the Investment Policy can be found in the full Investment Policy on the Company\u2019s website.\n66  Portfolio Value is calculated on a committed basis and at the time of investment.

Carey Olsen and Norton Rose Fulbright provide corporate legal \nsupport for the business in Guernsey and London, respectively, and tax services are provided by KPMG. Our registrar, Link Market \nServices, maintains the shareholder register and manages the processing of shareholder communications with our other advisers. \nRegarding public relations, TRIG receives advice and practical coordination from Maitland / AMO Strategic Advisers. TRIG also has \naccess to several key data providers, including technical reports in relation to acquisitions and regular power price forecasts and \ncommentary from several specialised providers. The Company\u2019s auditor is Deloitte. Additional independent valuation services are \nprovided by the accountants BDO from time to time. The Company also receives a range of other services, including shareholder list \nanalysis, webhosting, design and remuneration consulting.\nOperational partners:\nTRIG benefits from co-investing alongside several joint venture partners, some being developers and vendors, such as Equinor, Orsted, \nSSE and Akuo Energy and others being financial co-investment partners, for example APG and Equitix. In each case, the Managers \nbuild on the relationship with the co-investor, providing representatives to attend project board meetings to coordinate and monitor the \ninvestment, with the additional potential to share best practices.\nVendors:\nTRIG\u2019s reputation for reliability and efficiency in transaction management with a variety of vendor counterparties helps the Company to \ncontinue to derive value in origination by accessing projects off-market (including from RES itself under the right of first offer agreement).\nPortfolio Customers:\nAs an energy provider, TRIG\u2019s key customers are PPA counterparties. These offtakers pay for and receive TRIG\u2019s portfolio companies\u2019 \noutput \u2013 with revenues being payments for the renewables benefits as well as commercial power for those projects permitted to receive \npower market revenues.\nPortfolio Suppliers:\nTRIG\u2019s key operational suppliers include Original Equipment Manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), spare part O&M providers and increasingly \nIndependent Service Providers (\u201cISPs\u201d). On construction projects the key suppliers are the EPC contractors, turbine suppliers and \nbalance of plant contractors. Utilities also provide certain site-specific services such as meter readings. The operations teams maintain \nrelationships with the site landowners who receive rental payments. Lenders to the project companies include many leading domestic \nand international banking groups. TRIG\u2019s Managers maintain discussions with key lenders as there are opportunities to refinance \nprojects as market conditions allow, and this has been done selectively within the portfolio to date.\nLocal Communities:\nTRIG is conscious of its role in the local communities in which its projects operate.

The culture is informed by its vision to create a future where everyone has \naccess to affordable zero carbon energy, plus the values of Passion, Accountability, Collaboration and Excellence (PACE).\nRES encourages a range of activities to support staff in their own volunteering and charitable fundraising activity through paid time off \nand fund matching.

Both InfraRed and RES have anti-\ncorruption and bribery policies in place to maintain high standards of business integrity, a commitment to truth and fair dealing and a \ncommitment to complying with all applicable laws and regulations.\nBoth Managers have training for anti-bribery and corruption which all employees are required to complete annually.\nAll counterparties undergo processes to mitigate against bribery and corruption. When InfraRed completes acquisitions on behalf of \nTRIG, vendor due diligence is performed, and all sales and purchase agreements are required to have anti-bribery and corruption \nprotection clauses.\n67  Principles for Responsible Investment (\u201cPRI\u201d) ratings are based on following a set of Principles, including incorporating ESG issues into investment analysis, \ndecision-making processes and ownership policies.

The \nBoard has put in place a framework for corporate governance \nwhich it believes is appropriate for an investment company \nin line with the best practices in relation to matters affecting \nshareholders, communities, regulators and other stakeholders \nof the Company. With a range of relevant skills and experience, \nall Directors contribute to the Board discussions and debates \non corporate governance. In particular, the Board believes in \nproviding as much transparency for investors as is reasonably \npossible to ensure investors can clearly understand the prospects \nof the business and enhance liquidity of its shares whilst also \npreserving an appropriate level of commercial confidentiality.\nAIFM Directive\nThe Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive seeks to \nregulate alternative investment fund managers (in this paragraph, \n\u201cAIFM\u201d) and imposes obligations on managers who manage \nalternative investment funds (in this paragraph, \u201cAIF\u201d) in the EU or \nwho market shares in such funds to EU investors. The Company \nis categorised as a self-managed Non-EEA AIF for the purposes \nof the AIFM Directive. In order to maintain compliance with the \nAIFM Directive, the Company needs to comply with various \norganisational, operational and transparency obligations.\nAIC Code\nThe Board of TRIG has considered the Principles and Provisions \nof the AIC Code of Corporate Governance (AIC Code). The AIC \nCode addresses the Principles and Provisions set out in the UK \nCorporate Governance Code (the UK Code), as well as setting \nout additional provisions on issues that are of specific relevance \nto investment companies. The Board considers that reporting \nagainst the Principles and Provisions of the AIC Code, which \nhas been endorsed by the Financial Reporting Council and the \nGuernsey Financial Services Commission, provides more relevant \ninformation to shareholders. The company has complied with \nthe Principles and Provisions of the AIC Code. The AIC Code \nis available on the AIC website (www.theaic.co.uk). It includes \nan explanation of how the AIC Code adapts the Principles and \nProvisions set out in the UK Code to make them relevant for \ninvestment companies.\nStewardship Code\nThe Company\u2019s Managers are responsible for day-to-day \nmanagement of the portfolio and therefore are best placed to \nengage with portfolio companies and discharge stewardship \nobligations. Accordingly, TRIG becoming a signatory to the \nStewardship Code would unnecessarily duplicate the work of the \nManagers.\nThe Board has instead chosen to exercise stewardship by \nreporting against the AIC Code rather than by being signatories to \nthe Stewardship Code.Guernsey Regulatory Environment\nThe Guernsey Financial Services Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) \nissued a Finance Sector Code of Corporate Governance.

BoardAlpha does not have any other connection with \nthe Company and its Directors.\nBoardAlpha Limited concluded in their report that the Board \nis functioning at a high level. The report commented that the \nBoard has a tight grasp of strategic issues, with a strong level \nof involvement, and provide s constructive challenge s to the \nManagers. Through detailed reporting from the Managers, the \nBoard has excellent oversight of the portfolio, operations and \ninvesting activity and has a strong drive to protect shareholder \ninterests. Board members were considered to be well prepared \nfor meetings, and effective and professional in their decision -\nmaking and boardroom behaviour. BoardAlpha noted that \nthe Company\u2019s Board had undergone a significant degree \nof evolution recently and that the transition of the Board\u2019s \nmembership appeared to have been smooth and with good \nhandover periods. Overall, BoardAlpha concluded that the \nBoard worked well with the Managers, Company Secretary and \nother service providers and demonstrated a high standard of \ncorporate governance. A number of useful recommendations \nof an administrative nature were made by BoardAlpha that the \nCompany has taken on board.\nThe Board continues to monitor training for Directors. The \nDirectors consider and regularly  report their training needs and \ncontinuing professional development and training carried out. \nFor example, during the year, the Directors attended courses on \nrelevant subjects including cyber security, risk management, tax, \nsustainability and diversity . The Directors have indicated a desire \nfor a more formalised and regular training, a programme of which \nis being developed with the Company Secretary.\nSite visits are considered important to the Board\u2019s oversight \nof the Company. The last three years have presented  logistical \nchallenges associated with Covid-19 such as travel restrictions \nand social distancing requirements. Nonetheless, Erna-Maria \nTrixl visited one of the Company\u2019s UK onshore wind projects with \nthe Managers  and Investors  once restrictions were removed. \nThe Managers are working with the Board to select sites for \nannual Board visits to help build a stronger understanding of the \noperational environment of the Company on a day-to-day basis.\nA key element of the Board\u2019s role is to engage with investors, \nincluding to provide reassurance as to the robustness of their \noversight of the business. During 202 2, the outgoing Chairman \nof the Company, Helen Mahy, and incoming Chairman Richard \nMorse met a number of institutional shareholders and answered \nquestions on the Company\u2019s governance. All members of \nthe Board also had the opportunity to meet investors at the \nCompany\u2019s Capital Markets Day in April 2022. Shareholders are \nalso able to attend or dial into and ask questions of the Directors \nat the Company\u2019s Annual General Meeting.Given responsible investment considerations are at the heart of \nthe Company\u2019s strategy, the Board will be establishing a further \ncommittee to specifically consider ing ESG and Sustainability. \nAs the Company grows in size and  complexity, it is considered \nthat the formation of this committee will provide more focused \nconsideration of these important topics.\nThe Directors engage with the senior leadership of both Managers \nto understand succession planning at each of the Managers\u2019 \norganisations. Towards the end of 2022, there was also an \nincrease in the contact between the Board and the day-to-day \nmanagement team of TRIG to delve into specific matters in more \ndetail as required and leverage the particular skill set of individual \nBoard members, as well as help utilise the time at Board \nmeetings most effectively as the Company continues to grow in \ncomplexity.\nThe independence of each Director has been considered and \neach has been confirmed as being independent of the Company \nand its Managers. The Board believes that the composition of \nthe Board and its Committees reflect a suitable mix of skills and \nexperience, and that the Board, as a whole, and its Committees \nfunctioned effectively during 2022 and since the launch of the \nCompany in 2013.\nAs with the previous Directors of TRIG, the current Board is \ndiverse in its composition and thought processes.

Market quotations are not \navailable for these financial assets, and as such, their valuation \nis undertaken using a discounted cash flow methodology. This \nrequires a series of material judgements to be made, as further \nexplained in Note 4 to the financial statements.\nThe valuation process and methodology were discussed by the \nAudit Committee with the Investment Manager at the time of the \ninterim review, in November 2022 prior to the year-end valuation \nprocess and again in February 2023 as part of the year-end sign-\noff process. The Committee met with the auditor when it reviewed \nand agreed the auditor\u2019s Group audit plan and also at the \nconclusion of the audit of the financial statements, in particular \ndiscussing the valuation process. The Investment Manager \ncarries out a valuation semi-annually and provides a detailed \nvaluation report to the Company. The Company also engaged a \nthird-party valuation expert to provide an independent valuation \nat June 2022 and also to review the valuation discount rates at \nDecember 2022. In July 2022 the expert provided a report to the \nAudit Committee that corroborated the valuation of the portfolio \nas at June 2022. The expert also provided a report to the Audit \nCommittee in February 2023 confirming that the discount rates \nadopted at 31\u00a0December 2022 were reasonable.\nValuation of Investments \u2013 key forecast assumptions\nThe Audit Committee considered in detail those assumptions \nthat are subject to judgement that have a material impact on the \nvaluation. The key assumptions are: \nPower Price Assumptions\nA significant proportion of the wind and solar projects\u2019 income \nstreams are contracted subsidy receipts and power income under \nlong-term PPAs; some of which have fixed price mechanisms. \nHowever, over time the proportion of power income that is fixed \nreduces and the proportion where the Company has exposure to \nwholesale electricity prices increases. The Investment Manager \nconsiders the forecasts provided by a number of expert energy \nadvisers and adopts a profile of assumed future power prices by \njurisdiction. Further detail on the assumptions made in relation \nto power prices and other variables that may be expected to \naffect these are included in the Valuation section of the Strategic \nReport.\nMacroeconomic Assumptions\nMacroeconomic assumptions include inflation, foreign exchange, \ninterest and tax rate assumptions. The Investment Manager\u2019s \nassumptions in this area are set out and explained in the \nValuation section of the Strategic Report.\nOther Key Income and Costs Assumptions\nOther key assumptions include operating costs, facility energy \ngeneration levels and facility remaining operating life assumptions.The Audit Committee considers the remaining operating life \nassumptions in light of public information provided by the \nCompany\u2019s peer group and reports provided by the Operations \nManager during the year, considering the remaining operational \nlives for investments and considering any potential extension of \nthose lives and the recognition of additional value resulting to be \nappropriate. The independent valuation carried out in June 2022 \nalso supported the assumed operating lives.\nThe Investment Manager has discussed and agreed the valuation \nassumptions with the Audit Committee . The Audit Committee \nheld discussions with the external auditor and the Investment \nManager and ensured appropriate challenge was applied . In \nrelation to the key judgements underpinning the valuation, the \nInvestment Manager has provided sensitivities showing the \nimpact of changing these assumptions and these have been \nreviewed by the Investment Manager and the Audit Committee \nto assist in forming an opinion on the fairness and balance of \nthe annual report together with their conclusion on the overall \nvaluation.\nValuation Discount Rates\nThe bifurcated discount rates adopted to determine the valuation \nare selected and recommended by the Investment Manager. The \nCompany uses a bifurcated discount rate approach (as more fully \nexplained on page 56). \nThe discount rate is applied to the expected future cash flows \nfor each investment\u2019s financial forecasts derived adopting the \nassumptions explained above, amongst others, to arrive at \na valuation (using a discounted cash flow methodology). The \nresulting valuation is sensitive to the discount rates selected. \nThe Investment Manager is experienced and active in the area of \nvaluing these investments and adopts discount rates reflecting its \ncurrent extensive experience of the market.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07520b90-3d32-4052-8d0e-7f062c72eeef": {"__data__": {"id_": "07520b90-3d32-4052-8d0e-7f062c72eeef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dfb49e69-1c5a-4bf0-b87b-b8f0627f2cb2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "42272035fb9fceea139bc8ecb0892324df848586db972ea120ffd4be306ed6d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1eab4c71-c790-406c-be18-a6313631df9c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "2d9a5996398e3303eac45aa4076a3d7a3f2fe08f06bd0da1cd0207a8d6978555", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d244a2ca-a72a-40a1-8525-4190aa5dff15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "b4ff04a93a13713e29e5edccfc669cbd429a58bb04adae72a9ddf540f32914be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9e406813fd0bc86a4204e3c255957bc57eec196ea6186f6d4aa5ff0d7217502b", "text": "Valuation Discount Rates\nThe bifurcated discount rates adopted to determine the valuation \nare selected and recommended by the Investment Manager.

On the \nbasis of their audit work there were no adjustments proposed \nthat were material in the context of the financial statements as \nSection Number Heading 0", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d244a2ca-a72a-40a1-8525-4190aa5dff15": {"__data__": {"id_": "d244a2ca-a72a-40a1-8525-4190aa5dff15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c8b005dd-164c-4879-888a-1ddc006b7a8d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "515d5c91d5b904cf453ddccbae97a1358103ca28cb8a104074a92b3abd7a0e6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "07520b90-3d32-4052-8d0e-7f062c72eeef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "9e406813fd0bc86a4204e3c255957bc57eec196ea6186f6d4aa5ff0d7217502b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d922022-30f1-4ca0-84c0-402f665c19f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "117", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "587bb5a9f5058be7537af342d80a2fb08c58b83a70a1b423a1b8bf21b8151707", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b4ff04a93a13713e29e5edccfc669cbd429a58bb04adae72a9ddf540f32914be", "text": "TRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022 117\nSECTION 4:  \nDIRECTORS\u2019 REPORTa whole. Please refer to Section 5 for the Independent Auditor\u2019s \nReport to the Members of The Renewables Infrastructure Group \nLimited. \nInternal Controls and Risk Management\nThe Board is responsible for the Company\u2019s system of internal \ncontrol and for reviewing its effectiveness and has therefore \nestablished an ongoing process designed to meet the particular \nneeds of the Company in managing the risks to which it is \nexposed.\nThe process is a risk-based approach to internal control through \na matrix which identifies the key functions carried out by the \nInvestment Manager, Operations Manager and other service \nproviders; the various activities undertaken within those functions; \nthe risks associated with each activity; and the controls employed \nto minimise and mitigate those risks. A scoring based on 1 to \n5 for Likelihood and 1 to 5 for Impact is used and these are \nmultiplied together to give a total score. Mitigation is considered \non a scale of 1 to 5 and this leads to a residual risk rating being \nderived. The matrix is updated on an ongoing basis and reviewed \nquarterly and the Board considers all material changes to the \nrisk ratings and the action which has been, or is being, taken. By \ntheir nature, these procedures will provide a reasonable, but not \nabsolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\nAt each Board meeting, the Board also monitors the Group\u2019s \ninvestment performance and it reviews the Group\u2019s activities \nsince the last Board meeting to ensure that the Investment \nManager is adhering to the Company\u2019s Investment Policy and \napproved investment guidelines. The pipeline of new potential \nopportunities is considered and the prices paid for new \ninvestments during the quarter are also reviewed.\nFurther, at each Board meeting, the Board receives reports \nfrom the Company Secretary and Administrator in respect of \ncompliance matters and duties they have performed on behalf of \nthe Company.\nThe Board has considered the need for an internal audit function \nand it has decided that the systems and procedures employed \nby the Investment Manager, the Operations Manager and the \nAdministrator, including their own internal review processes \nand the processes in place in relation to the Company, provide \nsufficient assurance that a sound system of internal control, which \nsafeguards the Company\u2019s assets, is maintained. An internal \naudit function specific to the Company is therefore considered \nunnecessary. There is no impact on the work of the external \nauditor as a result of not having an internal audit function.\nThe Board recognises that these control systems can only be \ndesigned to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to \nachieve business objectives, and to provide reasonable, but not \nabsolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss, and \nrelies on the operating controls established by the Company\u2019s \nAdministrator, the Investment Manager and the Operations \nManager. The Board considers on a periodic basis whether further third-party assurance is appropriate, and reviews at least \nannually the proficiency of such controls in light of changes in the \nbusiness and its environment.\nThe Investment Manager prepares management accounts and \nupdates business forecasts on a quarterly basis, which allow \nthe Board to assess the Company\u2019s activities and review its \nperformance. The Board and the Investment Manager have \nagreed clearly defined investment criteria, return targets, risk \nappetite and exposure limits. Reports on these performance \nmeasures, coupled with cash projections and investment \nvaluations, are submitted to the Board at each quarterly meeting.\nThe Operations Manager prepares quarterly project performance \nand project financial analysis, and highlights the key activities \nperformed and any specific new risks identified relating to the \noperating portfolio for consideration by the Board.\nAppointment of the external auditor\nDeloitte LLP was first appointed to be external auditor for the \nTRIG Group on 19 September 2013 and reappointed for a \nsecond time following an extensive audit tender process that \nconcluded in December 2021. Deloitte\u2019s reappointment was \nsubsequently ratified by shareholders at the Company\u2019s AGM in \nMay 2022.\nIn line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and in particular \nthe requirement to put the external audit out to tender at least \nevery 10 years, the Audit Committee conducted a tender \nexercise for the external audit of the Company during 2021, as \ncommunicated fully in the Audit Committee report 12 months \nago. The tender exercise was run during the ninth year of \nDeloitte\u2019s appointment as the Company\u2019s auditor.

Tove Feld was appointed Chair of the Remuneration \nCommittee on 1 March 2022 following Shelagh Mason\u2019s \nretirement from TRIG\u2019s Board of Directors.\nThe terms of reference of the Committee are to determine and \nagree the Board policy for the remuneration of the Directors of \nthe Company, including the approval of any ad  hoc payments in \nrespect of additional corporate work required (e.g. for the work \ninvolved with the issue of prospectuses and equity fund raises).\nStatement of the Chair of the Remuneration Committee\nAs all Directors of the Company are non-executive, they receive \nan annual fee appropriate for their responsibilities and time \ncommitment but there are no other incentive programmes or \nperformance-related emoluments.\nDuring the year, the Committee considered the external advice \nreceived from Trust Associates in 2020, which noted that should \ninflation rise significantly , the Remuneration Committee could then \nconsider greater increases than in previous years. As such, the \nRemuneration Committee procured further external advice from \nTrust Associates as to the appropriate fees for 2023 given the \nhigh level of inflation being experienced. The Committee\u2019s 2022 \nreview of Directors\u2019 remuneration also took into account inter \nalia fair and equitable treatment of Directors, market conditions \nand changes in the activities and scale of the Company. The \nCommittee\u2019s review of Directors\u2019 remuneration considered:\n\t\u25b2The increase in the net assets of TRIG, the number of \nassets in the portfolio, the size of individual assets and \nco-investing and partnering activities;\n\t\u25b2The time commitment required to appropriately perform \neach Director\u2019s role and their responsibilities in respect of \nTRIG;\n\t\u25b2Additional fees where a Director\u2019s duties extend beyond \nthose normally expected as part of the Director\u2019s \nappointment (e.g. Chair of the Board or one of its \nCommittees, or Senior Independent Director); and\n\t\u25b2Market remuneration levels, including inter alia  with \nreference to the renewables and infrastructure investment \ncompany peer group, to attract and retain high-calibre \ndirectors.\nThe Committee proposes and the Board has, subject to \nShareholders\u2019 approval, agreed to implement increases of \nbetween 4-5% as set out in the table below, which is within \nthe guidance provided by Trust Associates. The proposed \nremuneration for the Chair of the Board remains less than that \npreviously proposed by Trust Associates in 2020, and balances \nthe increase in time commitment to perform the role and the \nlevel of remuneration presented to candidates through the Board \nsuccession recruitment process, with the ongoing challenging \neconomic conditions resulting from the pressure on the cost \nof living from high rates of inflation notwithstanding that the operations of the Company are continuing with no material \nadverse effect.\nThe Remuneration Committee has commissioned an external, \nindependent review of Directors\u2019 remuneration in 2023.\nRemuneration Policy\nAll Directors of the Company are non-executive and as such there \nare:\n\t\u25b2no service contracts with the Company;\n\t\u25b2no long-term incentive schemes;\n\t\u25b2no options or similar performance incentives; and\n\t\u25b2no payments for loss of office unless approved by \nshareholder resolution.\nThe Directors\u2019 remuneration shall:\n\t\u25b2reflect the responsibility, experience, time commitment and \nposition on the Board;\n\t\u25b2allow the Chair of the Board, the Senior Independent \nDirector and the Chair of each of the Board\u2019s committees \nto be remunerated in excess of the remaining Board \nmembers to reflect their increased roles of responsibility \nand accountability;\n\t\u25b2be paid quarterly in arrears;\n\t\u25b2include remuneration for additional, specific corporate work \nwhich shall be carefully considered and only become due \nand payable on completion of that work; and\n\t\u25b2be reviewed by an independent professional consultant \nwith experience of investment companies and their fee \nstructures, at least every three years.\nThe maximum annual limit of aggregate fees payable to the \nDirectors as set in the Articles of Association is \u00a3450,000.\nRemuneration Committee\nThe Remuneration Committee met three  times during 2022 \nto consider the remuneration of the Directors. Its membership \ncomprised all Directors of the Company, which was deemed \nappropriate as they are each independent and have the requisite \nknowledge of the Company and experience to appropriately \ndetermine remuneration.\nSection Number Heading 0Directors\u2019 \nRemuneration Report4.5", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0afd892f-4dec-4d91-b483-b8f1f7e1fb98": {"__data__": {"id_": "0afd892f-4dec-4d91-b483-b8f1f7e1fb98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "707b735d-20dc-477b-9595-c4301eb1fbf5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "121", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "d483391ac5fd49af29039e8309f9c3094d82042deac01ef71fd6871447d0bd4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "47f08dc5-81b9-4ec0-894e-c28e13a544d0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "5954f6b7b606a5c8d3f73194d86e156d5d233c6e9d24fe2d347ac1d9150909f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b057d30f-2c84-4a77-88c5-6990945e22d1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "122", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "757ba91890f1f06cde75c9c3ce4b4587aa496efd09151edfa614c65f15cd3746", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9be2b3ff6d2f2234a8d156f685015326f1773f4d5a47992ad3ee0a7a02f423ef", "text": "TRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022 121\nSECTION 4:  \nDIRECTORS\u2019 REPORTThe table below sets out the Remuneration Committee\u2019s recommendation for annual base fees for 2023:\nRole2023 \nRemuneration2022 \nRemuneration\nChair of the Board \u00a392,500 \u00a388,000\nDirector \u00a356,500 \u00a354,000\nThe Remuneration Committee confirmed its recommendation for the annual supplement for the additional responsibilities and activities \nof Directors:\nRole2023 \nAdditional \nremuneration2022 \nAdditional \nremuneration\nSenior Independent Director \u00a33,500 Nil\nAudit Committee Chair \u00a313,000 \u00a312,500\nOther Committee Chair * \u00a33,500 \u00a33,500\n*  Paid to the chair of the Management Engagement Committee, Remuneration Committee and new committees formed; excludes the Nomination Committee and \nthe Market Disclosure Committee, which are chaired by the Chair of the Board and are included in the fee payable to the Chair of the Board.\nThe table below sets out the Directors\u2019 remuneration approved and actually paid for the year to 31 December 2022 as well as the \nestimated remuneration for the year ending 31 December 2023 based on the rates set out in the tables above.

The \nBoard has satisfied itself in relation to its key service providers \nthat they have reasonable provisions in place to prevent the \ncriminal facilitation of tax evasion by their own associated persons \nand will not work with service providers who do not demonstrate \nthe same zero-tolerance commitment to preventing persons \nassociated with it from engaging in criminal facilitation of tax \nevasion.\nGoing Concern\nThe financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity \nposition and borrowing facilities are described in Section 3.2 \n(page 67), Analysis of Financial Results of the Strategic Report. \nIn addition, Notes 1 to 4 to the financial statements include the \nGroup\u2019s objectives, policies and processes for managing its \ncapital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its \nfinancial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to \ncredit risk and liquidity risk. The Group has the necessary financial resources to meet its \nobligations for the foreseeable future. The Group benefits from \na range of long-term contracts with various major UK and \nEuropean utilities and well-established suppliers across a range of \ninfrastructure projects. \nOn 3 February 2023, the revolving credit facility was renewed \nand extended from \u00a3600m to \u00a3750m with an expiry date of \n31\u00a0December 2025. The revolving credit facility includes a \nworking capital component of \u00a345m and is limited to 30% of \nPortfolio Value. The Group\u2019s project-level financing is non-\nrecourse to the Company and is limited to 50% of Gross Portfolio \nValue. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is \nwell placed to manage its business risks successfully.\nThe Company has a number of commitments related to the \nconstruction of assets held within the portfolio and has sufficient \nheadroom in its revolving credit facility to finance these activities.\nThe Company has sufficient headroom on its revolving credit \nfacility covenants. These covenants have been tested and relate \nto interest cover ratios and group gearing limits and the Company \ndoes not expect these covenants to be breached. The Company \nand its direct subsidiaries have a number of guarantees, detailed \nin note 20 of these financial statements. These guarantees relate \nto certain obligations that may become due by the underlying \ninvestments over their useful economic lives. We do not anticipate \nthese guarantees to be called in the next 12 months and in many \ncases the potential obligations are insured by the underlying \ninvestments.\nThe Directors have assessed ongoing risks (such as recovery \nfrom Covid-19, rising inflation and interest rates, the Ukraine \nconflict, and global supply chain issues) and do not believe \nthat there is a significant risk to the business as a result of \nthese uncertainties and will continue to monitor any future \ndevelopments. \nThe Company is affected by climate-related risks, as set out in \nthe Company\u2019s TCFD reporting, and the Board consider these \nwhen they assess the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going \nconcern. The Company continues to assess, monitor and where \nnecessary and possible, mitigate and manage these risks.\nThe Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has \nadequate resources to continue in operational existence for the \nforeseeable future.

\n\t\u25b2are satisfied the Company has adequate safeguards and \nprocedures in place to function effectively and ensure \noperational continuity in  the event of a major business \ninterruption (such as a  pandemic  or cyber attack ) including \nstep-in plans for key personnel  and systems ;

The latest \nauthority for the Company to make market purchases of Ordinary \nShares was granted to the Directors on 27 May 2022 and expires \non the date of the next Annual General Meeting. The Directors are \nproposing that their authority to buy back shares be renewed at \nthe forthcoming Annual General Meeting.\nTreasury Shares\nSection 315 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 allows \ncompanies to hold shares acquired by market purchase as \ntreasury shares, rather than having to cancel them. Up to 14.99% \nof the number of shares in issue at the date of the last AGM (5 \nMay 2021) may be held in treasury and may be subsequently \ncancelled or sold for cash in the market. This gives the Company \nthe ability to reissue shares quickly and cost-efficiently, thereby \nimproving liquidity and providing the Company with additional \nflexibility in the management of its capital base.\nThere are currently no shares held in treasury. The Board would \nonly authorise the sale of shares from treasury at prices at or \nabove the prevailing net asset value per share (plus costs of the \nrelevant sale). If such a measure were to be implemented, this \nwould result in a positive overall effect on the Company\u2019s net \nasset value.

Our application of materiality\n6.1. Materiality\nWe define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions \nof a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work \nand in evaluating the results of our work.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\nMateriality \u00a366.0m (2021: \u00a354.0m)\nBasis for determining \nmateriality2% of shareholders\u2019 equity (2021: 2% of shareholders\u2019 equity)\nRationale for the \nbenchmark appliedWe consider equity to be the key benchmark used by shareholders of the company in assessing finan -\ncial performance. The reason for the significant increase in materiality relates to the growth in this bench -\nmark, which has been primarily driven by increases in investments at fair value through profit or loss.\nMaterialityShareholders\u2019 equityShareholders\u2019 equity\n\u00a33,342.7mMateriality \u00a366.0m\nAudit Committee\nreporting threshold\n\u00a33.3m\nA lower materiality threshold of \u00a34.2m (2021: \u00a33.1m) based upon 3% of income from investments (excluding fair value movements in \nthe portfolio valuation) has also been used. This has been applied to balances in the income statement and balance sheet, excluding \nfair value of investments and derivatives balances and their associated fair value movements, due to qualitative factors of stakeholder \ninterest.\n6.2. Performance materiality\nWe set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected \nmisstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. Performance materiality was set at 70% of materiality for \nthe 2022 audit (2021: 70%). In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors:\na. the quality of the control environment; and\nb. the low level of corrected and uncorrected misstatements identified in the prior period.\n6.3. Error reporting threshold\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of \u00a33.3m (2021: \u00a32.7m) in \nrespect of the balances associated with the portfolio valuation, and all audit differences in excess of \u00a30.21m (2021: \u00a30.16m) for all other \nbalances, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the \nAudit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n7. An overview of the scope of our audit\n7.1.

Our consideration of climate-related risks \nManagement has considered transition and physical risks when factoring in climate change as part of their risk assessment process \nwhen considering the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company. These risks have been focused on the assumptions \nunderlying the valuation of investments, and include power price forecasts, energy yields, asset availability and maintenance costs. In \nour evaluation of the climate-related risks facing the company, we considered that the key assumption is the power price forecasts; \nthis is linked to the key audit matter as highlighted in section 5.1, where we have described both the risks related to these assumptions \nand our audit procedures in relation to the challenge of this assumption. The climate change risk factors underpinning the assumptions \nhave been explained in note 3 of the financial statements. With the involvement of our ESG specialists, we have evaluated the \nappropriateness of disclosures included in the financial statements and have read the annual report to consider whether other climate \nchange disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained in the audit, including the \nconsideration of net zero power curves used to assess the impact of certain transition risks on the valuation of the portfolio. \n8. Other information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor\u2019s \nreport thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion \nthereon.\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with \nthe financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\nIf we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to \na material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a \nmaterial misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n9. Responsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors\u2019 responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial \nstatements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is \nnecessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, \ndisclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either \nintend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n10.  Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material \nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a \nhigh level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material \nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, \nthey could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC\u2019s website at: www.frc.org.uk/\nauditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor\u2019s report.\n11.  Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our \nresponsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our \nprocedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n11.1  Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities\nIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and \nregulations, we considered the following:\nSECTION 5:  \nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6bdcc3c-1b6a-46d6-ab3f-4850edeb8a7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6bdcc3c-1b6a-46d6-ab3f-4850edeb8a7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "57dc14c4-49c9-46f1-acee-81bace1426fb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "a905da513ac3df4a02fccdf5679cd540af2398edc6fe3a6092d2806dfaddbe40", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a582556-d4ca-4742-93ea-8f47515ece96", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "c927b25f0c2dcd1c9b33e7d04c7e2d899017cfef250017ececcc776443f995d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "18090fab-e3ad-4f37-bf44-f917a74faaeb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "ab870cb702532d00155322e0eda4b6ffb35f2f4cbbf419d9538305e8d8216675", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0622565d10e9a05c45c1448f6e149ca323564f5026f0741ce21806b6edd08b6a", "text": "136 TRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 20225.1\nIndependent Auditor\u2019s Report\nto the Members of The Renewables Infrastructure Group Limited (continued)\n\t\u25b2the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the company\u2019s \nremuneration policies, key drivers for directors\u2019 remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;\n\t\u25b2results of our enquiries of management, the directors and the Audit Committee about their own identification and assessment of the \nrisks of irregularities, including those that are specific to the company\u2019s sector; \n\t\u25b2any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the company\u2019s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:\n oidentifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;\n odetecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;\n othe internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;\n\t\u25b2the matters discussed among the audit engagement team and relevant internal specialists, including tax and valuations specialists \nregarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.\nAs a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and \nidentified the greatest potential for fraud in the assessment of fair value of investments. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we \nare also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.\nWe also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the company operates in, focusing on provisions of those \nlaws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The \nkey laws and regulations we considered in this context included the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, the Listing Rules and relevant \ntax legislation.\nIn addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but \ncompliance with which may be fundamental to the company\u2019s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. The key laws and \nregulations we considered in this context included the Alternative Investment Fund Managers (\u201cAIFM\u201d) Directive, Association of \nInvestment Companies (\u201cAIC\u201d) Code of Corporate Governance, Non-Mainstream Pooled Investments (\u201cNMPI\u201d) regulations.  \n11.2  Audit response to risks identified\nAs a result of performing the above, we identified the assessment of the fair value of investments as a key audit matter related to the \npotential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matter in more detail and also describes the specific \nprocedures we performed in response to that key audit matter. \nIn addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:\n\t\u25b2reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of \nrelevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;\n\t\u25b2enquiring of management and the Audit Committee concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;\n\t\u25b2performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement \ndue to fraud;\n\t\u25b2reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance; and\n\t\u25b2in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other \nadjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and \nevaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.\nWe also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including \ninternal specialists, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.\nReport on other legal and regulatory requirements\n12.

General information\nThe Renewables Infrastructure Group Limited (\u201cTRIG\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a closed -ended investment company incorporated in \nGuernsey under Section 20 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008. The shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange \nunder a premium listing. Through its subsidiaries, The Renewables Infrastructure Group (UK) Limited (\u201cTRIG UK\u201d), and The Renewables \nInfrastructure Group (UK) Investments Limited (\u201cTRIG UK I\u201d), TRIG invests in mainly operational renewable energy generation projects, \npredominantly in onshore and offshore wind and solar PV segments, across the UK and Europe. The Company, TRIG UK, TRIG UK I \nand its portfolio of investments are known as the \u201cGroup\u201d.\nThese financial statements are for the year ended 31 December 2022 and comprise only the results of the Company , as all of its \nsubsidiaries are measured at fair value as explained below in Note 2 (a).\n2. Key accounting policies\n(a) Basis of preparation\nThe financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 21 February 2023.\nThe financial statements, which give a true and fair view, have been prepared in compliance with the Companies (Guernsey) Law, \n2008 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) as adopted by the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) using the \nhistorical cost basis, except that the financial instruments classified at fair value through profit or loss are stated at their fair values. All \naccounting policies have been applied consistently in these financial statements.\nThe financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Company\u2019s functional currency. Foreign operations are included \nin accordance with the policies set out in this note.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires the Directors to make judgements, \nestimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and \nexpense. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to \nbe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets \nand liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in \nthe year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year , or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision \naffects both current and future years. Note 3 shows critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions.\n(b) Going concern\nThe Group\u2019s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out \nin the Strategic Report and also commented on in the Viability Statement on page 82. The financial position of the Group, its cash \nflows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Results on pages 67 to 73 . In addition, Notes 1 to 4 of \nthe financial statements include the Group\u2019s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management \nobjectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.\nThe Group has the necessary financial resources to meet its obligations for the foreseeable future. The Group benefits from a range \nof long-term contracts with various major UK and European utilities and well-established suppliers across a range of infrastructure \nprojects. \nOn 3 February 2023, the revolving credit facility was renewed and extended from \u00a3600m to \u00a3750m with an expiry date of 31 December \n2025. The revolving credit facility includes a working capital component of \u00a345m and is limited to 30% of Portfolio Value. \nThe revolving credit facility is ESG-linked, resulting in a possible increase or reduction to future interest payments based on the  \ncompany\u2019s performance against KPIs relating to ESG targets over time.\nThe Group\u2019s project-level financing is non \u2013 recourse to the Company and is limited to 50% of Gross Portfolio Value. As a consequence, \nthe Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. \nAt 31 December 2022, the Company\u2019s leverage was 11% for fund -level financing (2021: 3%) and 38% for project -level financing (2021: \n40%).\nThe Company has sufficient headroom on its revolving credit facility covenants.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44f29240-9642-4bbe-b475-a4ce64be4e93": {"__data__": {"id_": "44f29240-9642-4bbe-b475-a4ce64be4e93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9db4eb4f-ccec-4ece-b7b2-76d78163e38b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "d84f2705fc2607b8532755384d61443c952bb7a4352744e00ce9a51647ca0604", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e71c922e-81a3-4e8b-bd74-dc62b69daa88", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "152e3e8ad1c01e48272354ee9594a02b47da04b9402d7f3d575104ef84bc67b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "88e0a743-5775-4333-b1a6-53e492d7dc60", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "0990ab2dc7717f6d6fad561326f17f093faef951d5b53a30474234537d653fe5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "28fe6ab1dd908d87c7555f70ac8ab0f66e73874c9ae8efa631f23d292c30917b", "text": "The revolving credit facility includes a working capital component of \u00a345m and is limited to 30% of Portfolio Value. \nThe revolving credit facility is ESG-linked, resulting in a possible increase or reduction to future interest payments based on the  \ncompany\u2019s performance against KPIs relating to ESG targets over time.\nThe Group\u2019s project-level financing is non \u2013 recourse to the Company and is limited to 50% of Gross Portfolio Value.

We do not anticipate these guarantees \nto be called in the next 12 months and in many cases the potential obligations are insured by the underlying investments.\nA cash balance of \u00a324.5m at 31 December 2022 is held by the Company, with further amounts held in the Company\u2019s direct and \nindirect subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has a working capital facility on its revised revolving credit facility of \u00a345m, which remains \nundrawn at the date of signing this report.\nFurther to the above, the Company has a number of outstanding commitments which are detailed in Section 2.2 of this Annual Report  \nand Note 2 0 of these financial  statements . These commitments can be fully covered by the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility.\nAs a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. The directors do not \nbelieve that there is a significant risk to the business as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine but will continue to monitor any future \ndevelopments.\nThe Company is affected by climate-related risks, as set out in the Company\u2019s TCFD reporting, and the Board consider these when \nthey assess the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company continues to assess, monitor and where necessary \nand possible, mitigate and manage these risks.\nHaving performed the assessment of going concern, the Directors considered it appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the \nCompany on a going concern basis. The Company has sufficient financial resources and liquidity and is well placed to manage business \nrisks in the current economic environment (including but not limited to the conflict in Ukraine and current upward inflationary pressures) \nand can continue operations for a period of at least 12 months from the date of these financial statements.\n(c) Basis of consolidation\nThe Company applies IFRS 10 \u201cConsolidated Financial Statements\u201d, and as an investment entity is required to measure all of its \nsubsidiaries at fair value. The financial statements therefore comprise the results of the Company only. Subsidiaries are those entities \nowned by the Company. The Company has ownership of an investee, when it is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its \ninvolvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee as defined in IFRS 10 \n\u201cConsolidated Financial Statements\u201d.\nThe Directors believe it is appropriate and relevant to the investor to account for the investment portfolio at fair value, where \nconsolidating it would not be.\nThe Company\u2019s subsidiaries, TRIG UK and TRIG UK I, carry out investment activities and incur overheads and borrowings on behalf of \nthe Group. The Directors therefore provide an alternative presentation of the Company\u2019s results in the Strategic Report on pages 67 to \n73 prepared under the \u201cExpanded basis\u201d, which includes the consolidation of TRIG UK and TRIG UK I.\nAn entity shall consider all facts and circumstances when assessing whether it is an investment entity, including its purpose and design. \nUnder the definition of an investment entity, as set out in paragraph 27 in the standard, the entity must satisfy all three of the following \ntests:\n\t\u25b2Obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investors with investment management services; and\n\t\u25b2Commits to its investors that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income or \nboth (including having an exit strategy for investments); and\n\t\u25b2Measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis.\nIn respect of the first criterion, TRIG is an investment company which enables shareholders to gain exposure to a diversified portfolio of \nrenewable energy and related infrastructure investments coupled with the management of these investments.\nIn respect of the second criterion, the Company\u2019s purpose is to invest funds for returns from capital appreciation and investment \nincome.

Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the instrument expire or the asset \nis transferred, and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IFRS 9 \u201cFinancial Instruments \u201d.\nFinancial derivatives are valued using a mark to market valuation based on the underlying derivative contracts that are executed with the \nbanks.  The movements in mark to market valuation are recognised in the profit and loss statement.\nNon-derivative financial instruments\nNon-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash \nequivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.\nNon-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value (including directly attributable transaction costs where these \ninstruments are held at amortised cost). Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative financial instruments are measured as \ndescribed below.\nInvestments in equity and debt securities\nInvestments in the equity, loan stock and mezzanine debt of entities engaged in renewable energy activities are designated upon initial \nrecognition as held at fair value through profit or loss. Gains or losses resulting from the movement in fair value are recognised in the \nIncome Statement at each valuation point.\nFinancial assets are recognised/derecognised at fair value at the date of the purchase/disposal. A financial asset (in whole or part) is \nderecognised either:\n\t\u25b2when the group has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership; or\n\t\u25b2when it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards when it no longer has control over the asset or a \nportion of the asset; or\n\t\u25b2when the contractual rights to receive cash flow have expired.\nThe initial difference between the transaction price and the fair value, derived from using the discounted cash flows methodology at \nthe date of acquisition, is recognised only when observable market data indicates there is a change in a factor that market participants \nwould consider in setting the price of that investment. For the years ended 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021, there were no \nsuch differences.\nThe Group manages these investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value.\nThe Directors consider the equity and loan stock to share the same investment characteristics and risks and they are therefore treated \nas a single unit of account for valuation purposes and a single class for disclosure purposes.\n(e) Impairment\nFinancial assets\nFinancial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet \ndate. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect \non the estimated future cash flows of that asset. An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is \ncalculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the \noriginal effective interest rate. Significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets \nare assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. All impairment losses are recognised in the income \nstatement. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was \nrecognised. For financial assets measured at amortised cost the reversal is recognised in the income statement.

Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and \nassumptions in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant \nrisk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.\nKey source of estimation uncertainty: Investments at fair value through profit or loss\nIFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value \nis defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market \nparticipants at the measurement date. The Board base the fair value of the investments on information received from the Investment \nManager. Fair value is calculated on a discounted cash flow basis.\nFair values for those investments for which a market quote is not available, in this instance being all investments, are determined using \nthe income approach, which discounts the expected cash flows at the appropriate rate. In determining the discount rate, relevant \nlong-term government bond yields, specific risks associated with the technology (onshore wind, offshore wind, battery storage and \nsolar) and geographic location of the underlying investment, and the evidence of recent transactions  have all been considered . The \ninvestments at fair value through profit or loss, whose fair values include the use of level 3 inputs, are valued by discounting future cash \nflows from investments in both equity (dividends and equity redemptions) and subordinated loans (interest and repayments) to the \nGroup at an appropriate discount rate.\nThe weighted average discount rate applied in the December 2022 valuation was 7.2% (2021: 6.6%). The discount rate is considered \none of the most significant unobservable inputs through which an increase or decrease would have a material impact on the fair value of \nthe investments at fair value through profit or loss , which are further discussed in Note 4 under sensitivities.\nThe other material impacts on the measurement of fair value are the forward-looking power price curve, energy yields, operating costs \nand macro \u00a0economic assumptions (including rates of inflation) which are further discussed in Note 4 under sensitivities. The company \nconsiders climate -related risks such as power prices (including the impact of net zero curves), asset availability and maintenance \ncosts when assessing these assumptions. Further information on these climate change risks is discussed in more detail in part 4 of \nSection \u00a03.6 in of this Annual Report.\nThe Investment Manager, when considering the assumptions to apply to the valuation of the investments at 31 December 2022 , \nconsiders several key assumptions.\nKey judgements\nBy virtue of the Company\u2019s status as an investment fund, and in conjunction with IFRS 10 for investment entities, investments are \ndesignated upon initial recognition to be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.\nThe Directors consider that the carrying value amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the \nfinancial statement are approximately equal to their fair values.\n4. Financial instruments\nFinancial risk management\nThe objective of the Group\u2019s financial risk management is to manage and control the risk exposures of its investment portfolio. The \nBoard of Directors has overall responsibility for overseeing the management of financial risks, however the review and management \nof financial risks are delegated to the Investment Manager, which has documented procedures designed to identify, monitor and \nmanage the financial risks to which the Group is exposed. Note 4 presents information about the Group\u2019s exposure to financial risks, its \nobjectives, policies and processes for managing risk and the Group\u2019s management of its financial resources.\nThrough its subsidiaries, TRIG UK and TRIG UK I, the Company invests in a portfolio of investments predominantly in the subordinated \nloan stock and ordinary equity of renewable energy project companies.

Senior debt financing of project companies is generally either through floating rate debt, fixed rate bonds or \nindex -linked bonds. Where senior debt is floating rate, the projects typically have similar length hedging arrangements in place, which \nare monitored by the project companies\u2019 managers, finance parties and boards of directors.\nThe revolving credit facility is ESG-linked, resulting in a possible increase or reduction to future interest payments based on the Group\u2019s \nperformance against KPIs relating to ESG targets over time. More details can be found in part 11 of Section 3.6 of this annual report.\nInflation risk\nThe Group\u2019s project companies are generally structured so that contractual income and costs are either wholly or partially linked to \nspecific inflation, where possible, to minimise the risks of mismatch between income and costs due to movements in inflation indexes. \nThe Group\u2019s overall cash flows vary with inflation, although they are not directly correlated as not all flows are indexed. The effects of \nthese inflation changes do not always immediately flow through to the Group\u2019s cash flows, particularly where a project\u2019s loan stock \ndebt carries a fixed coupon and the inflation changes flow through by way of changes to dividends in future years. Inflation is managed \nthrough the use of inflation -linked swaps where the Group deems it to be appropriate. The sensitivity of the portfolio valuation is shown \nfurther on in Note 4.\nMarket risk\nReturns from the Group\u2019s investments are affected by the price at which the investments are acquired. The value of these investments \nwill be a function of the discounted value of their expected future cash flows, and as such will vary with, inter alia , movements in interest \nrates, market prices and the competition for such assets. The Investment Manager carries out a full valuation semi-annually and this \nvaluation exercise considers changes described above.\nCurrency risk\nThe projects in which the Group invests all conduct their business and pay interest, dividends and principal in sterling, with the \nexception of the euro-denominated investments which at 31 December 2022 comprised 41% (2021: 37%) of the portfolio by value on \nan invested basis and 41% (2021: 42%) of the portfolio by value on a committed basis. The sensitivity of the portfolio valuation is shown \nin this note.\nThe Group monitors its foreign exchange exposures using its near-term and long-term cash flow forecasts. Its policy is to use foreign \nexchange hedging to provide protection to the level of sterling distributions that the Company aims to pay over the medium \u00a0term, where \nconsidered appropriate. This may involve the use of forward exchange.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty of the Group will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the \nGroup. Key credit ratings for the Company\u2019s counterparties are detailed in Note 18.\nThe credit standing of subcontractors is reviewed, and the risk of default estimated for each significant counterparty position. Monitoring \nis ongoing, and year-end positions are reported to the Board on a quarterly basis.

The Group\u2019s approach to \nmanaging liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to meet its liabilities when \ndue. The Group ensures it maintains adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring \nforecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group\u2019s investments are \npredominantly funded by share capital and medium-term debt funding.\nThe Group\u2019s investments are generally in private companies, in which there is no listed market and therefore such investment would \ntake time to realise, and there is no assurance that the valuations placed on the investments would be achieved from any such sale \nprocess.\nThe Group\u2019s investments have borrowings which rank senior and have priority over the Group\u2019s own investments into the companies. \nThis senior debt is structured such that, under normal operating conditions, it will be repaid within the expected life of the projects. Debt \nraised by the investment companies from third parties is without recourse to the Group.\nThe Group\u2019s revolving credit facility, which was \u00a3398.5m drawn at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: \u00a372.8m), is held by TRIG \nUK and TRIG UK I, and is guaranteed by the Company.

The Group \nuses the income approach, which discounts the expected cash flows attributable to each asset at an appropriate rate to arrive at fair \nvalues. In determining the discount rate, relevant long-term government bond yields, the specific risks of each investment and the \nevidence of recent transactions  are taken into account .\nDerivative financial instruments\nThe fair value of financial instrument inputs other than quoted prices traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the \nbalance sheet date. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. Note 2 discloses the \nmethods used in determining fair values on a specific asset/liability basis.

Section 2.5, as of the balance sheet date legislation was enacted or in the process of being enacted within each of the \njurisdictions in which the Group has invested, which would impact generating assets under specific conditions in relation to the revenue \nreceived from the sale of electricity at elevated prices.\nWithin the UK the Electricity Generator Levy (\u201cEGL\u201d) (published as draft legislation in December) is expected to be incorporated \nwithin the Spring Finance Bill 2023. It will have effect from 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2028 and applies a levy of 45% (which is not \ndeductible for corporation tax, resulting in an effective tax rate (when considering levy and tax) of 70%) to revenues received for the sale \nof wholesale above a threshold level. The threshold level for revenues is \u00a375 per MWh (indexed by the Consumer Prices Index on 1\u00a0April \neach year from 2024) +\u00a310m per annum per group  allowance  (with the  UK assets the Group holds considered one group). The EGL \nhas been reflected within the valuation and the valuation sensitivities for the legislated period (beyond which the prices assumed would \nbe below the threshold level).\nThe European Union had introduced a legislative framework to apply Inframarginal Caps, under which each of the national governments \ncan introduce legislation within specified parameters. This would seek to apply a tax in respect of  revenues received in excess \nof a threshold price  (typically the applicable tax rate is between 90% to 100%). The threshold price is determined by the national \ngovernments and can vary by technology. In general , the legislation as enacted or planned to be enacted is for a relatively limited \nduration with an expectation that this would be extended as required \u2013 as such the valuation and sensitivities assume that the legislation \nwill apply until the prices drop below the applicable threshold level, with the threshold level expected to remain constant in real terms.\nWithin Iberia , specific legislation applies (which would have a more significant impact than the inframarginal cap) to both cap the price of \ngas used for electricity generation and to clawback prices received by generators over a level based upon an assumed gas price where \nthey do not incur the cost of purchasing gas. The valuation and sensitivities assume these pieces of legislation will be extended until the \nprices fall below the threshold level, with the threshold level expected to remain constant in real terms.\nA summary of the intervention measures is included within the table below:\nTax Measure Market Applies aboveEffective rate \napplicable Reliefs Legislated period\nElectricity Generator Levy   UK\u00a375/MWh indexed \nby CPI70%  \n(45% levy + \n25% corporate \ntax)First \u00a310m p.a.  \nper group1 Jan 2023 to  \n31 Mar 2028\nInframarginal Revenue Cap  \n \n \n \n Ireland EUR 120/MWh 100% None stated1 Jan 2023 to  \n30 Jun 2023\nFrance EUR 100/MWh 90%Excludes FiT\u2019s \nand CfD\u2019s1 Jul 2022 to  \n31 Dec 2023\nGermanyFeed in Tariff  \n+ EUR 30/MWh 90%Allowance for \nPPA costs1 Dec 2022 to  \n30 Jun 2023\nSweden EUR 180/MWh 90% None stated1 Jan 2023 to  \n30 Jun 2023\nGas Clawback  \n Spain and \nPortugalA calculated level \nbased on assumed \ngas price 85%Formula \nincludes an \nallowance to \nreflect some \ncostsEnacted in 2021, \napplicable  \nto 31 Dec 2023 \nValuation sensitivities\nSensitivity analysis is produced to show the impact of changes in key assumptions adopted to arrive at the valuation.

Hence the P50 is the expected level of generation over the long term.\nThe sensitivity illustrates the effect of assuming \u201cP90 10-year\u201d (a downside case) and \u201cP10 10-year\u201d (an upside case) energy production \nscenarios. A P90 10-year downside case assumes the average annual level of electricity generation that has a 90% probability of being \nexceeded over a 10-year period. A P10 10-year upside case assumes the average annual level of electricity generation that has a 10% \nprobability of being exceeded over a 10-year period.

In each case it is assumed that the change in exchange rate occurs from 1 January 2023 and thereafter remains \nconstant at the new level throughout the life of the projects.\nAt the year \u00a0end, 41% of the committed portfolio was located in Sweden, France, Germany, Ireland and Spain comprising \neuro-denominated assets.\nThe Group has entered into forward hedging of the expected euro distributions for up to 48 months ahead , and in addition placed \nfurther hedges to reach a position where at least 60% of the valuation of euro-denominated assets is hedged. The hedge reduces the \nsensitivity of the portfolio value to foreign exchange movements and accordingly the impact is shown net of the benefit of the foreign \nexchange hedge in place.

The Company intends to issue these shares on 31 March \n2023.\nThe Company is governed by a Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), all of whom are independent and non-executive. During  the year, the \nBoard  received fees for their services. Further details are provided in the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report on page 121. Total fees for \nthe Directors for the year were \u00a3361,044 (2021: \u00a3338,500). Directors\u2019 expenses of \u00a31 1,477  (2021: \u00a33,510) were also paid in the year.  \nThere are no other Key Management personnel within the Company.\nAll of the above transactions were undertaken on an arm\u2019s length basis.\n20. Guarantees and other commitments\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries had provided \u00a3164.0m (2021: \u00a3177.0m) in guarantees in relation to \nprojects in the TRIG portfolio.\nThe Company also guarantees the revolving credit facility, entered into by TRIG UK and TRIG UK I, which it may use to acquire further \ninvestments.\nAs at 31 December 2022 the Company has \u00a3204.5m of future investment obligations (2021: \u00a3231.2m).\nMore details on timing and amounts can be found in Section 2.2 of the Strategic Report.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries have issued decommissioning and other similar guarantee bonds with a total value of \u00a344.4m (2021: \n\u00a322.8m).\n21. Contingent consideration\nThe Group has performance-related contingent consideration obligations of up to \u00a30.4m (2021: \u00a31.8m) relating to acquisitions \ncompleted prior to 31 December 2022. These payments depend on the performance of certain wind farms and other contracted \nenhancements. The valuation of the investments in the portfolio does not assume that these enhancements are achieved. If further \npayments do become due, they would be expected to be offset by an improvement in investment. The arrangements are generally \ntwo-way in that if performance is below base case levels some refund of consideration may become due.\n22. Events after the balance sheet date\nOn 2 February 2023, the Company declared an interim dividend of 1.71 pence per share for the period 1 October 2022 to \n31\u00a0December 2022.

\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe assess our performance using a variety of measures that are not specifically defined under IFRS. These alternative performance \nmeasures are termed \u201cAPMs\u201d. The APMs that we use may not be directly comparable with those used by other companies.\nThese APMs are used to present an alternative view of how the Company has performed over the year and are all financial measures of \nhistorical performance.\nThe table below defines our APMs and how they relate to the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, The Renewables Infrastructure Group UK \nLimited (\u201cTRIG UK\u201d) and The Renewables Infrastructure Group UK Investments Limited (\u201cTRIG UK I\u201d).\nPerformance Measure Definition\nInvestments made This is a measure of amounts invested into the portfolio of investments less any amounts relating to \nrefinance proceeds or sell -downs.\nThe IFRS measure of investments made consists of funding into TRIG UK and TRIG UK \u00a0I, which is \nshown in more detail in Note 13 of these financial statements.\nTRIG invests in its portfolio through its subsidiaries, TRIG UK and TRIG UK I. This is a measure of the \nvaluation of the portfolio of investments only. It is exclusive of cash, working capital and debt balances \nin TRIG UK and TRIG UK I.\nDirectors\u2019 Portfolio Valuation TRIG invests in its portfolio through its subsidiaries, TRIG UK and TRIG UK I. This is a measure of the \nvaluation of the portfolio of investments only. It is exclusive of cash, working capital and debt balances \nin TRIG UK and TRIG UK I. \nThe IFRS measure of investments at fair value through profit or loss is the Directors \u2019 Portfolio Value plus \nthe fair val ue of net assets inc luding cash, working  capital and debt he ld in TRIG UK and TRIG UK I.\nDirectors \u2019 Portfolio Value (or Portfolio Value) is reconciled to investments at fair value through profit or \nloss in Note 13 of these financial statements.\nNAV per share This is a measure of  Net Asset Value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per ordinary share  in the Company and is calculated as \nthe NAV divided by the total number of shares in issue at the balance sheet  date . \nThe calculation uses IFRS measures and is explained further in Note 12 of these financial statements.\nTotal shareholder s\u2019 return for the year (share \nprice appreciation plus dividends paid)The Internal Rate of Return upon the share price at 31 December 2021 (134.4p) of dividends \n(quarterly as paid totalling 6.82p as detailed in note 11 of these financial statements) plus the share \nprice at 31 December 2022 (130.0p).\nTotal NAV return for the year (NAV per share \nappreciation plus dividends paid)The Internal Rate of Return upon the NAV at 31 December 2021 (119.3p) of dividends (quarterly as \npaid totalling 6.82p as detailed in note 11 of these financial statements) plus the NAV at 31 December \n2022 (134.6p).\nDividend Cover Dividend Cover is calculated as Cashflow from Operations (which is an Expanded Basis measure \nexplained in section 3.2 and reconciled to the IFRS measure) divided by Dividends paid in the year.\nDividend Cover, when expressed on a cash basis, has cash dividends paid as the denominator and is \ncalculated as 1.55 times for 2022.\nDividend Cover, when expressed as being without the benefit of scrip dividends, has the scrip \ndividends allocated to shareholders in lieu of cash dividends added to the cash dividends paid for \nthe calculation.
