The definition of each of these measures is shown on page 175.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nThe NAV per share as at 31 December 2022 is calculated on the basis of the 2,483,583,248 Ordinary Shares in issue and to be issued as at 31 December 2022 due to the Managers\u2019 shares in part payment of the management fee. The 6.84p per share dividend delivered related to performance during the 2022 financial year. The 7.18p is a dividend per share target for financial perfor- mance during 2023.

The case for investment in renewables has never been stronger, particularly in the context of the immediate energy security and affordability challenges, as well as the decarbonisation agenda. TRIG offers investors access to otherwise illiquid renewables infrastructure and the opportunity for participation in the net zero transition. The Company is also very well supported by Managers who share the Board\u2019s commitment to providing sustainable income and capital growth through investing in the transition to net zero.\n\nOver the next ten years, 63% of TRIG\u2019s forecast revenues are directly linked to inflation through subsidy support mechanisms, with the majority of remaining revenues indirectly linked to inflation due to the relationship between power prices and inflation indices, providing strong inflation protection. The combination of a high degree of fixed revenues, strong inflation correlation and power price forecasts that fully incorporate government interventions, serve to reduce the risks arising from a volatile macro outlook.\n\nThe Company has limited interest rate and refinancing risk. Interest rates on debt across the portfolio investments are substantially fixed. The Company has no structural short-to- medium term debt and interest paid on the Group\u2019s revolving credit facility (\u201cRCF\u201d)18 is linked to overnight interest rates. At the time of publication, the RCF is \u00a3413m drawn, with substantial headroom compared to its enlarged \u00a3750m committed capacity, and matures in December 2025.\n\nIncreases in interest rates during the year and the impact of the UK mini-budget have led to a sustained period of share prices trading at discounts to Net Asset Values across real assets investments companies. Specifically for the energy sub-sector, governments\u2019 interventions have also weighed on investor sentiment. In this context, TRIG\u2019s diverse portfolio, which has been stress-tested through the pandemic and the more recent energy crisis, ensures that the Company is strategically well positioned in 2023 to continue to enhance value for shareholders and contribute to greater energy security and faster decarbonisation.\n\nForecast cash flows from the portfolio indicate that the majority of these drawings can be repaid from re-investment cash flows over the RCF term.\n\nDividends Strong achieved power prices and close-to-budget asset availability, tempered by below-budget generation, have contributed to strong dividend cover in 2022. After operating and finance costs, net cash flow covered the cash dividend 1.5 times19, or 2.6 times before repayment of project-level debt.\n\n15 Based on NAV per share appreciation plus dividends paid during the year ended 31 December 2022. 16\n\nFrom 1 January 2022 to 21 February 2023.

The Company\u2019s investment strategy remains unchanged, targeting renewables and related infrastructure investments21 in the UK and mainland Europe22.\n\nTRIG\u2019s largest investment during the period was a 10% stake in the 1.2GW Hornsea One offshore wind farm in the UK. The Group also made an incremental investment in the Merkur offshore wind farm in Germany, a project we are very familiar with having first invested in 2019. Offshore wind farms have an important role to play in the portfolio: each of our six offshore wind projects benefits from protected cash flows for the term of their government support arrangements, which reduces the sensitivity of their equity returns to changes in power price levels. These investments help to facilitate the addition of unsubsidised, higher-returning projects into the portfolio, such as the March 2022 acquisition of a 49% stake in the Valdesolar solar park in Spain, whilst maintaining the portfolio\u2019s overall power price sensitivity.\n\nConstruction and development assets offer a source of higher risk-adjusted returns too. We are grateful to shareholders for their support at the 2022 AGM to increase TRIG\u2019s construction and development investment limit from 15% to 25%. In 2022, TRIG acquired four development-stage battery storage sites, which will provide c. 700MWh / 350MW flexible capacity once built. Flexible capacity, which includes battery storage, is critical to the energy transition and complements TRIG\u2019s renewable generation assets as it responds, and financially benefits from, the intermittency of renewables and electricity price volatility. At the period end, construction and development exposure represented 8% of the total portfolio.\n\nPortfolio performance Overall portfolio electricity generation in the year was 5% below budget due to lower than expected weather resource in some geographies and downtime resulting from both enhancement activities and unscheduled maintenance. Further detail is provided in Section 2.3 \u2013 Operations Report.\n\ncapacity is currently being commissioned, with Gr\u00f6nhult onshore wind farm and the Cadiz solar projects well progressed and close to construction completion; both are in the final commissioning stages and exporting electricity. A further 471MW of capacity is in construction or development.\n\nHealth and Safety (\u201cH&S\u201d) has always been core to operations across TRIG\u2019s portfolio. H&S performance is regularly reviewed at both the project company level and by the Board across the whole portfolio, and we continually strive to promote a strong safety culture.\n\nSustainability Sustainability, and the consideration of environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) factors, is central to TRIG\u2019s strategy and InfraRed and RES\u2019s investment and asset management ethos, further details of which can be found in TRIG\u2019s annual Sustainability Report.\n\nThe United Nations Climate Change conference (COP27) in November 2022 and the UN Biodiversity Summit (COP15) in December 2022 highlighted the role of infrastructure in arresting and reducing the impact of adverse climate change and protecting the environment.\n\nTRIG makes a significant contribution to tackling climate change. Our current commercially operational portfolio of 2GW is capable of powering 1.8 million homes and avoiding approximately 2.2 million tonnes of carbon emissions per annum23. TRIG committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2021, and has published estimated scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions for its entire portfolio. We will be setting SBTi targets in line with this initiative during 2023.\n\nCorporate Governance In accordance with the Board\u2019s succession plan, 2022 saw the retirement of TRIG\u2019s initial three Non-executive Directors: Helen Mahy, Shelagh Mason and Jon Bridel. On behalf of my fellow Directors and the Managers, I would like to thank them for their service to TRIG\u2019s shareholders and their many contributions to the success of the Company over the nine years since IPO.

The evaluation noted that TRIG\u2019s Board is functioning at a high level and that the transition to new Directors has been smooth.\n\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties The Board and the Managers monitor and, where practicable, mitigate a range of risks to TRIG\u2019s strategy. TRIG\u2019s principal risks are:\n\n\u25b2 Regulation and taxation: government or regulatory support for renewables changing adversely, or further intervention by governments in the electricity generation sector to levy generators for power prices achieved above threshold levels;\n\n\u25b2 Power prices: electricity prices falling or not increasing as\n\nUkraine has underscored the importance of energy security and affordability.\n\nFor the energy sector, this has resulted in an increase in the attraction of, and competition for, renewables infrastructure assets, and an increase in power prices and resulting government intervention. In this context, the Company\u2019s business model and investment portfolio has demonstrated its inherent resilience and relevance. As governments across Europe look to fiscal policy as a means to address costs to consumers, we believe that our model has demonstrated the ability to withstand these changes and still deliver significant returns for our shareholders.\n\nAt 2.8GW24, capable of generating the equivalent to 1.6% of the UK\u2019s electricity usage, TRIG\u2019s diverse portfolio is significant. Within the portfolio, the Managers continue to enhance value.

The Company made investments into seven projects during the year, each of which will contribute to further portfolio resilience:\n\n\u25b2 The high revenues generated in the year as a result of\n\nparticularly high wholesale power prices coupled with higher subsidies as a result of inflation indexation passing through\n\n\u25b2 Increases in the portfolio valuation as a result of\n\nexpectations for power prices and inflation to continue to be elevated over the short to medium term compared to expectations last year\n\n\u25b2 The acquisition of a 49% equity stake in the 264MW Valdesolar solar PV project, an unsubsidised project in Spain. The Company is partnered with Repsol, the Spanish-listed global energy company. The project has the ability to capture merchant power prices.\n\n\u25b2 The portfolio valuation increase has been offset to some extent by an increase in the portfolio weighted average discount rate of 0.5%, recognising the increased levels of government bond yields. The discount rate applied to UK cash flows were increased by 0.8%, whilst the equivalent rate applied in Europe was increased by 0.3%, recognising the increased macro-economic volatility in the UK in the second half of the year\n\n\u25b2 The acquisition of a 10.2% stake in Hornsea One in the UK, one of the world\u2019s largest operational offshore wind farms, and an incremental investment in the Merkur offshore wind farm taking TRIG\u2019s stake from a 25% to 36% shareholding. Both continue the strategy of investing in projects that benefit from government-backed revenue support. Merkur also benefits from the current higher power prices due to the functioning of the German Feed-in Tariff which acts as a floor.\n\nGreater detail on these movements can be found in Section 3.1 \u2013 Valuation of the Portfolio.\n\nNet cash flow for 2022 was \u00a3249m30 (2021: \u00a3150m) resulting in dividend cover for the year of 1.5x before the benefit of scrip take- up (2021: 1.06x). With the benefit of scrip take-up, dividend cover for the year was 1.55x (2021: 1.12x). Net cash flows in 2022 benefited from high achieved power prices during the period.\n\n\u25b2 A strategic milestone was achieved with a significant investment in the flexible capacity sector through the acquisition of four in-development battery storage sites. The four projects have grid connection dates ranging from 2024 to 2031 and, once built, will have combined capacity of 350MW / 700MWh. Flexible capacity, including battery storage, is essential to the energy transition by providing grid-supporting services and responding to the intermittency of renewables generation. As such, flexible capacity projects provide a natural hedge within the portfolio for variability in market conditions.\n\nDividend cover is stated after the repayment of project-level amortising debt, reflecting the Company\u2019s capital structure and prudent debt management which seeks to repay project debt during subsidy periods without reliance on merchant receipts. \u00a3174m project-level amortising debt was repaid in 2022 (2021: \u00a3145m). Whilst we believe having an amortising debt profile is the most appropriate structure for the Company\u2019s risk profile, capital structures do vary between renewables investment companies. Were dividend cover to be calculated based on operating cash flows before the repayment of debt, dividend cover for 2022 would have been 2.55x (2021: 2.1x). The Company has declared a dividend target for 2023 of 7.18p per share, reflecting the high earnings and strong cover, but also recognising the importance of the long-term sustainability of the Company\u2019s dividend to shareholders.\n\nThe power price exposure of the portfolio as a whole is broadly unchanged as a result of the acquisitions in the year, as the Managers seek to maintain the power price risk profile of the Company.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f80013b-f336-4227-b792-c2cb746368b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f80013b-f336-4227-b792-c2cb746368b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49f69416-8357-49ca-a1e6-2a1f9e7be413", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "6905ebc85307bbc375aa0ebd89d0e3997049b36fa2cdad7fd6ecfec60dcc1b42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "06bbc839-603e-4b78-8405-a4dbd8b71a03", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "8c0082dde4e7a618d64d4a5482f95788d4ea4ee40808786f1c5dd045369e9dbd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f70b0384-cae9-43b4-b60a-f75cd57b38b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "5eb67dfebaad1ef408b85e79e18fc605d36e6c7dc82954d0bfd98446164f1848", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d37d60b88e7af8af81af88f9ccf66bc65eaaa9005e55293a24e427be73296675", "text": "\u00a3174m project-level amortising debt was repaid in 2022 (2021: \u00a3145m).

To date, TRIG has delivered 10 projects through construction since IPO, with five further projects expected to be delivered in Q1 2023. Development and construction also provides competitive access to projects that are increasingly being traded before construction has begun.\n\nTRIG\u2019s construction projects have progressed well during the year, with the Blary Hill and Haut Vannier projects becoming operational in 2022. Both Gr\u00f6nhult onshore wind farm and the Cadiz solar portfolio started initial generation in late 2022 and are now in the final stages of construction. Ranasj\u00f6 & Salsj\u00f6 foundation works are being finalised, with turbine delivery scheduled for later in 2023. Sustainability considerations are made throughout the construction of these projects \u2013 for example with local employment and environmental plans created to maintain a net positive impact for the community. Construction on the Cadiz projects has employed the equivalent of 108 personnel for a year and further hired services in the municipality of San Jose del Valle, with total local investment reaching \u20ac750,000.\n\nThe Company will begin to recognise the additional value derived from taking projects successfully through construction as key milestones are met, typically in the first 6\u201312 months from the commencement of operations.\n\nThe Managers continue to see construction and development projects as attractive opportunities to leverage the depth of their expertise and combined 60-year track record for the benefit of TRIG, and as some operating history is established we can look for valuation uplift.

CHART TO BE REDRAWN\n\nCHART TO BE REDRAWN\n\nOver the next 12 months, 65% (2021: 70%) of revenues are fixed per unit of generation, with 63% (2021: 66%) fixed over the next ten years. The decline in these percentages is largely driven by the elevated power prices in the near term compared to last year\u2019s assumptions.\n\n36 Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland form a Single Electricity Market, distinct from that operating in Great Britain. 37 Segmentation is based on the portfolio value on a committed basis.\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n23\n\n2.2 Investment Report (continued)\n\nForecast proportion of \ufb01xed vs. market revenues\n\nnext 12 months\n\nto December 2032\n\n65% Fixed\n\n63% Fixed\n\nFixed power price (partially indexed) \u2022 Market power price exposure\n\nThe large majority of the expected fixed revenues are derived from government subsidies. Of the 65% fixed over the next 12 months, 83% are drawn from subsidised projects in the UK, Ireland and France, which benefit from inflation linkage, helping to preserve Portfolio Value. Inflation is being driven to a large extent by commodity price increases, which ultimately benefit power prices. However, if non-energy related inflation were to persist more structurally, inflation linked revenues could play a key role in value preservation.\n\nIn the longer term, based on its current portfolio, TRIG is expected to have greater exposure to future wholesale electricity prices as subsidies and contracts with pre-determined pricing run off. As existing fixed-price contracts expire, the replacement contracts may also have fixed-price elements, and any future additions to the portfolio may have subsidies, decreasing the merchant proportion shown below.\n\nThe Company\u2019s prudent capital structure ensures all project-level debt is repaid within the associated subsidy period, and projects with merchant revenues do not have any debt in place. This has the result of releasing a greater portfolio of revenue in the future for re- investment and dividends.\n\nAs described in Section 2.5 \u2013 Market developments, governments in all the markets TRIG has investments in have announced or enacted interventions to reduce the wholesale power prices received by renewable energy projects. The interventions do not have an impact on subsidies revenues, but work to reduce or limit the wholesale power price achieved by renewable energy projects.\n\nThe chart below reflects the portfolio\u2019s forecast revenues on a committed basis (including the impact of government interventions), and therefore includes revenues expected from construction projects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32e7ec3d-1c4a-402c-9ccb-52c4e8ebbc32": {"__data__": {"id_": "32e7ec3d-1c4a-402c-9ccb-52c4e8ebbc32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49f69416-8357-49ca-a1e6-2a1f9e7be413", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "6905ebc85307bbc375aa0ebd89d0e3997049b36fa2cdad7fd6ecfec60dcc1b42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "05789efb-8450-47ad-9f12-ab94457d06a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "c40a561c52d9a2e2a1cdf748cf4a7ad9cdf37a8a54dea5dbfa563d1e4d5c6003", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fdc376ac-27ea-4bdc-90b6-e072bb131de6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "d3bd3d96f621c4334c1f3bd15e07af555d8dee7ca1cc46c0c286fe0c4388dffc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "902a4121362478af762f578dd436bc74cc05865cad9494258dc7ba9ccf7122c9", "text": "As existing fixed-price contracts expire, the replacement contracts may also have fixed-price elements, and any future additions to the portfolio may have subsidies, decreasing the merchant proportion shown below.\n\nThe Company\u2019s prudent capital structure ensures all project-level debt is repaid within the associated subsidy period, and projects with merchant revenues do not have any debt in place.

The Company benefits from subsidised revenues that are directly linked to inflation indices in the UK and France, which constitute more than half of the expected revenues across the Company\u2019s portfolio over the next 10 years.\n\nThe direct link to inflation, received from indexed subsidies, and the indirect link to inflation, observed in power prices over time, functions to offset potential associated increases in required investment returns (i.e. the valuation discount rates) when inflation increases.\n\nThis can be demonstrated through the following portfolio scenario analysis:\n\n\u25b2 If annual inflation rates were to be 0.5% higher than assumed in all forecast periods, portfolio returns would increase by 0.66%,\n\nbased on the Company\u2019s latest published sensitivities in Section 3.1.\n\n\u25b2 If inflation rates were to be 3% higher in 2023 than assumed, portfolio returns would increase by 0.41%.\n\nReductions in outturn inflation would have broadly similar negative impacts.\n\nIncrease to assumption NAV impact\n\n(pence per share)\n\nDecrease to assumption NAV impact (pence per share)\n\n+ / - 0.5% change in annual inflation rates\n\n6.1\n\n5.1\n\n+ / - 0.66% change in portfolio discount rate\n\n6.1\n\n5.7\n\n+ / - 0.41% change in portfolio discount rate\n\n3.7\n\n3.5\n\n+ / - 3% change in inflation rates for FY 2023\n\n3.5\n\n3.5\n\nThe portfolio return is positively correlated to inflation, which combined with the ongoing demand for critical renewables infrastructure make the Company\u2019s assets attractive to own in a shifting environment.\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n25\n\n2.2 Investment Report (continued)\n\nOutlook The Company has performed well in the year through strong earnings and NAV growth, benefiting from higher power prices through generating secure and clean electricity whilst also contributing to the alleviation of the cost of living crisis through additional taxation throughout the Company\u2019s key markets. The portfolio is well positioned to benefit from inflation protection whilst the Company\u2019s prudent capital structure ensures debt is repaid and has fixed costs, providing strong downside resilience to higher interest rates.\n\nThe critical themes of energy security, affordability and decarbonisation, together \u201cthe energy trilemma\u201d, underpin the positive outlook for renewables. Once built, renewable energy assets provide secure and locally-generated electricity without carbon emissions. The impetus behind the sector coupled with sustainability considerations should encourage the development of local supply chains and reduce the carbon content in construction.\n\nIn the wider context, energy security and affordability has been brought into sharp focus in 2022. Europe\u2019s dependence on external sources of key commodities has been highlighted emphatically by the reduction in Russian gas supply into Europe. Nonetheless, due to unseasonably warm weather spells across the UK and the European continent and government-guided reduction in energy demand in the EU, Europe is better placed at the end of 2022 than many had feared might be the case. Renewables infrastructure will also play an increasingly critical role in delivering further European energy independence.\n\nIn addition, decarbonisation and the transition to net zero remain central to government energy strategies, while elevated energy costs to consumers highlight the essential requirement for increased domestic generating capacity to make energy more affordable for all.\n\nCritical investment in the flexibility of grids is needed to balance the intermittency of renewables and improve reliability. As such, TRIG has increased its investment plans in this area over the last twelve months.\n\nAs we enter the next year of the energy transition, the Managers remain well placed to enhance the value of the Company\u2019s portfolio, source growth opportunities and be selective in their approach to new investments for TRIG.\n\n26\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\nOperations Report\n\n2.3\n\nSection NumberHeading 0\n\nSECTION 2: STRATEGIC REPORT\n\n2.3 Operations Report\n\nOperations summary The overall performance of the portfolio was significantly ahead of budget in the year driven by high electricity prices, REGO and auxiliary service revenues.

RES applies a structured framework to identify, appraise and implement enhancements at both individual and portfolio levels. Examples of some of the commercial and technical value enhancements secured in 2022 include:\n\n\u25b2 Blade improvements: Aerodynamic improvements to wind turbine blades have been developed with specialist, independent\n\nexperts to increase the efficiency of the blades in extracting energy from the wind. This enhancement has been rolled out at a Scottish onshore wind site following a successful trial, in which a 3% increase in energy yield was secured. Trials allow the site- specific conditions to be evaluated, including the turbine model and condition, local topography and wind characteristics such as shear and turbulence. A second Scottish site trial is currently underway, with other sites being assessed for further rollout, with greater emphasis on those onshore sites which use larger blades.\n\n\u25b2 Software upgrades: More recent vintages of wind turbines use sophisticated control systems to determine how the wind turbine responds to the environmental conditions, such as the yawing of the nacelle and pitching of the blades. Some of these software upgrades are more applicable to large turbine arrays with flatter topography such as offshore wind farms. Alternative software enhancements can also be used to secure improved performance on older turbines within the portfolio.\n\n\u25b2 TRIG is actively engaging with its offshore wind joint venture partners to identify and implement a wide range energy yield enhancements, for implementation during 2023. These enhancements include wake steering \u2013 whereby the overall site production is increased by reducing the wind obstructed by each turbine on those downwind from them and high wind ride through \u2013 allowing turbines to respond to and withstand gusting without shutting down whilst also avoiding excessive loading on the structures.

Each quarterly meeting of the TRIG Board starts with a discussion of Health & Safety across the portfolio. Health & Safety performance is reviewed at every project company board meeting throughout the year, using reporting obtained for every site in the portfolio, providing information on both leading and lagging indicators.\n\nLeading indicators are those activities pro-actively performed or data collated to help reduce the risk of an accident ever occurring, such as performing internal or external safety audits, safety-focussed site walk-overs supported by discussions with site personnel, as well as collating and sharing information on:\n\n\u25b2 Good Catches \u2013 potential hazards that are identified and controlled;\n\n\u25b2 Hazard Identifications \u2013 hazards that have the potential to cause harm but are currently uncontrolled.\n\nLagging indicators are more focussed on collecting data on events that occurred, ensuring that each is appropriately investigated and key contributing factors identified to enable actions to be taken to reduce future recurrence and severity, including through sharing information across different businesses. Lagging indicators include:\n\n\u25b2 Near-misses \u2013 unplanned or uncontrolled events that have the potential to cause harm or damage.\n\n\u25b2 Non-lost time accidents \u2013 where an injury is sustained, however slight, and the injured party is able to return to work on the same day as the accident. The difference between a near-miss and a non-lost time accident can often be down to an element of timing, separation or good fortune that broke the chain of events.\n\n\u25b2 Lost-time accidents: where an injury is sustained and the injured party is unable to return to work on the day following the\n\naccident. A seven day lost-time accident classification is also used to reflect a higher degree of severity, such that the injured party is unable to return to their normal duties within seven days of suffering the injury.\n\nThe following provides an update of Health & Safety items of note during 2022:\n\n\u25b2 There were no severe accidents across the portfolio during the year.

RES\u2019s TRIG Operations Management team attended a collaboration event in November which served as a great opportunity for owners and subcontractors to share their thoughts on key safety issues. In the same vein, RES continues to regularly hold its own Health & Safety coordination group to foster relationships between the various asset managers across the TRIG portfolio, share information and discuss matters that have occurred in the portfolio. This year it allowed those working on UK and German offshore sites to share their experiences, something that they wouldn\u2019t normally get the opportunity to do.\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n31\n\n2.3 Operations Report (continued)\n\nEvacuation exercise at Merkur, Germany\n\n32\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\nProjects in construction and development\n\nBy acquiring assets at an earlier stage in their development, TRIG seeks to access improved returns and a wider investment opportunity set.\n\nThe delivery and de-risking of projects through construction and development enhances value for shareholders who benefit from the shift to a lower discount rate used to value operational projects; and enable TRIG\u2019s Managers to deploy TRIG\u2019s balance sheet to create new low-carbon generation and flexible capacity to contribute to the decarbonisation of the electricity system and improve energy security.\n\nRES, then perform due diligence and structure each opportunity to ensure that risks are allocated to parties best positioned to manage them and that the returns reflect the risks being borne by TRIG\u2019s portfolio company. Once an investment is brought into the portfolio, RES, with input from InfraRed, actively oversees construction and development activities to manage costs, timetable, quality, contractor interface, transition into operations, stakeholder engagement and, importantly, health & safety.\n\nImportantly, TRIG benefits from its Managers\u2019 expertise in investing in and delivering infrastructure projects through construction and development: InfraRed as a greenfield investor for the past 25 years and RES as a developer and/or constructor of over 23GW and operator of over 10GW of renewable assets globally.\n\nIn sourcing construction and development stage investments, InfraRed carefully screens opportunities to ensure they are aligned with TRIG\u2019s portfolio construction strategy and are additive to the portfolio as a whole.

Due to the nature of renewable energy assets, a long-term view must be taken with sustainable business practices applied throughout each project lifecycle.\n\nThe Board and TRIG\u2019s Managers recognise that the Company\u2019s responsibility goes beyond climate-related environmental considerations alone and seek to incorporate sustainable practices which can meet the needs of the present generations without compromising the needs of future generations.\n\nTRIG\u2019s Core Sustainable Development Goal Contributions40 SDG contributions are made through our investments and our impact on the local communities around our assets Primarily, the Company\u2019s portfolio contributes towards:\n\nAffordable and Clean Energy By owning and operating renewable energy assets, TRIG is helping to provide clean energy across the UK and Europe. Providing investment funding for new greenfield infrastructure and acquiring operational assets allows developers to recycle capital into the build-out of more renewables assets. This recycling of capital contributes to a reduction in the cost of deploying renewables. TRIG\u2019s current operational portfolio is capable of powering the equivalent of 1.8 million homes with clean energy39.\n\nClimate Action Climate change measures are integrated into TRIG\u2019s policies and planning. This includes the assessment and reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities associated with our portfolio, as well as taking steps to reduce our carbon footprint. TRIG\u2019s operational portfolio contributes towards a net zero carbon future and is currently capable of offsetting more than 2.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, generating 5,376GWh of renewable electricity during 202241.\n\nSustainability regulation\n\nThe Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) The SFDR is an EU law which aims to standardise disclosure requirements on how financial market participants integrate environmental, social and governance factors in their investment decision-making and risk processes.

RES is also a signatory to the SBTi and offsets their operational emissions, including those associated with electricity usage and business travel. The TRIG Board adopts practices which help to maintain a low carbon footprint, including combining face-to-face meetings with virtual calls where appropriate and not printing Board papers. Emissions associated with the Board\u2019s business travel are offset.\n\nScience-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\n\nTRIG\u2019s portfolio contributes significantly to climate change mitigation through the avoidance of carbon emissions during the operational life of our renewables infrastructure assets. In 2021, the Company became an SBTi signatory to further efforts towards a net-zero carbon future by committing to setting science based targets. In order to develop a robust understanding of the Company\u2019s carbon footprint, current emissions and appropriate mitigation pathways, an established third-party sustainability consultant was engaged to assist in the collection and analysis of emissions data from each of our portfolio companies.\n\nDuring 2022, the Company collected and published Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions data for the entire portfolio. This establishes a baseline to develop relevant targets in line with the commitments of TRIG and its Managers.\n\nWe are currently engaging with the SBTi around the target-setting process to develop targets which appropriately reflect the Company\u2019s business of being a renewable energy generator and expect to submit and validate these during 2023. We are also improving our data collection processes through the TRIG ESG Survey, and through collaboration with the Company\u2019s value chain and key stakeholders. Continued stakeholder engagement is needed to understand and drive forward changes for a successful net zero roadmap. Further details on our carbon emissions data collection process can be found in our annual Sustainability Report.\n\n46\n\nhttps://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment\n\n40\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\nPreserving our natural environment\n\nTRIG acknowledges the importance of biodiversity within its portfolio activities and RES, as Operations Manager, works with individual project asset managers to preserve the natural environment.\n\nThis includes execution of environmental management plans agreed with the authorities during the project consenting process, undertaking vegetation surveys, preventing biodiversity loss, reducing waste and recycling where possible and careful usage of materials.\n\nOur approach has three key strategic aims, which are explained further in our Sustainability Report:\n\n\u25b2 Preserve\n\nCase study: Biodiversity progress at solar farms\n\nIn line with TRIG\u2019s approach to biodiversity, RES conducted a trial of sustainability-focused workshops to identify further enhancement and mitigation strategies for the solar and wind assets in the UK and Ireland. These workshops have resulted in the production of specialised biodiversity enhancement plans.\n\nDuring 2022, the first round of installation activities were successfully completed across several solar sites. At Parsonage solar farm in Somerset, this included the sowing of a specialist wildflower seed mix and the installation of ten bird and bat boxes. At Marvel Farms in the Isle of Wight, two beehives have been established with a local beekeeper, with the first successful honey harvest in early September.\n\n\u25b2 Improve\n\n\u25b2 Monitor and Report\n\nMoving forward, TRIG aims to enhance reporting and dialogue with key stakeholders to further improve understanding of biodiversity risks and opportunities.\n\nOpportunities in other regions TRIG has invested in are also being explored, so that meaningful enhancement works for the sites that are not already covered by detailed environmental assessments can be performed.\n\nSDG alignment47\n\nWildflower meadows are planted at Parsonage solar farm in Somerset, offering a boost to British wildlife\n\n47 https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n41\n\n2.4 Sustainability (continued)\n\nSocial\n\nPositively impact the communities in which TRIG works With renewable energy assets often located in rural areas where communities may experience limited employment options and limited social or health facilities, TRIG is sensitive to the impact that a project can have on its local community.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "797ebe67-ea49-46c6-957a-0570313aca92": {"__data__": {"id_": "797ebe67-ea49-46c6-957a-0570313aca92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49f69416-8357-49ca-a1e6-2a1f9e7be413", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "6905ebc85307bbc375aa0ebd89d0e3997049b36fa2cdad7fd6ecfec60dcc1b42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d6072ab-fd07-4fb8-8b2e-fa4846514340", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "cb85ebeac420b6bd036fcf6a77be2b72250369be6136e5f7f18daf6c525b894d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9483dcc1-4b42-43cb-ab45-f48ce8cb0cc3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "989af21a7813498c2ab5ab037c5d3b785c5a530bd7db641270021995fed350f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "80beec054fb51a1f7a3c5483e51974bdd6ce8acf2a1aa85853a066c91cad43b4", "text": "\u25b2 Improve\n\n\u25b2 Monitor and Report\n\nMoving forward, TRIG aims to enhance reporting and dialogue with key stakeholders to further improve understanding of biodiversity risks and opportunities.\n\nOpportunities in other regions TRIG has invested in are also being explored, so that meaningful enhancement works for the sites that are not already covered by detailed environmental assessments can be performed.\n\nSDG alignment47\n\nWildflower meadows are planted at Parsonage solar farm in Somerset, offering a boost to British wildlife\n\n47 https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n41\n\n2.4 Sustainability (continued)\n\nSocial\n\nPositively impact the communities in which TRIG works With renewable energy assets often located in rural areas where communities may experience limited employment options and limited social or health facilities, TRIG is sensitive to the impact that a project can have on its local community.\n\nSDG alignment1\n\nThrough local initiatives and direct engagement with communities, tangible benefits can be created.\n\nTRIG has no direct employees, but actively engages with its Managers in respect of their employee engagement programmes.

Over the period Russia reduced exports of gas to the region, including the indefinite shutdown of the Nord Stream gas pipeline in response to sanctions related to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. This led to an increase in power prices due to the link between gas prices and power prices in much of Europe. Compounding this was a strong recovery in demand for electricity from Covid-19-related lows of the two previous years.\n\nIn order to reduce dependence on Russian gas imports, European governments and institutions proactively intervened to increase energy storage levels and reduce energy consumption, which combined with relatively mild weather during Q4 2022 has alleviated some pressure on current and near-term forward power prices.\n\nHowever, power prices remain sensitive to demand and supply pressures (including weather and power plant outages) and are expected to remain above historical levels for some years.\n\nGas storage levels compared to forward power prices in the EU\n\n700\n\n100\n\n90\n\n600\n\n80\n\n500\n\n70\n\n)\n\n) h W M / \u00a3 ( e c i r P r e w o P\n\n%\n\n(\n\ns l e v e L e g a r o t S s a G\n\n60\n\n400\n\n50\n\n300\n\n40\n\n30\n\n200\n\n20\n\n100\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10-Year Range\n\n10-Year Avg.\n\nEU Gas Storage\n\nWinter 2023/24 GB Power Price\n\nSource: InfraRed analysis of Argus Media and GIE AISBL data\n\n48\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\nMarket Developments\n\n2.5\n\nSection NumberHeading 0\n\nSECTION 2: STRATEGIC REPORT\n\nThe below charts show the forward power prices in each of the markets in which TRIG has investments.

The main areas for consultation included: locational pricing, low carbon and capacity subsidy mechanisms55 and alternatives to marginal pricing. Further details of potential reforms are expected to be communicated by government in H1 2023.\n\nWe believe that the proposal to offer Contracts for Difference (CfD) to operational low carbon generators, referred to as \u2018Pot\n\nZero\u2019, represents a viable mechanism to decouple power prices from gas prices. Such a system would have the advantage of lowering consumer bills during periods of high power prices while lowering the cost of capital for generators by removing the risk of lower wholesale power prices. We have made clear to the government that it is important for such a mechanism to be voluntary in order to maintain the integrity of long-term investment decisions as well as for a genuine market to be established that is able to provide firm investment signals. The Company, through the activities of its Managers, continues to engage with the UK government on the long-term design of the GB power market.\n\nEuropean Union The European Council initiated a programme in December 2022 to assess options to reform European electricity markets.

A valuation is carried out on a six-monthly basis as at 30 June and 31 December each year.\n\nFor non-market traded investments (being all the investments in the current portfolio), the valuation is based on a discounted cash flow methodology and accordance with IFRS 13 and IFRS 10, given the special nature of infrastructure investments.\n\nThe valuation for each investment in the portfolio is derived from the application of an appropriate discount rate to reflect the perceived risk to the investment\u2019s future cash flows in order to give the present value of those cash flows. The Investment Manager exercises its judgement in assessing the expected future cash flows from each investment based on the project\u2019s expected life and the financial model produced by each project entity. In determining the appropriate discount rate to apply to a given investment, the Investment Manager takes into account the relative risks associated with the revenues, which include fixed price per MWh income (lower risk) or merchant power sales income (higher risk). Where a project has both income types a theoretical split of future receipts has been applied, with a different (higher) discount rate used for an investment\u2019s return deriving from the merchant income compared to the fixed price income, equivalent to using an appropriate blended rate for the investment.\n\nThe Directors\u2019 Valuation of the portfolio as at 31 December 2022 was \u00a33,737.0m.

This includes coal as a stopgap measure (notwithstanding its high carbon tax). This transition has resulted in wholesale power price forecasts remaining elevated across the 2020s before reverting to the levels similar to those being forecast at the previous year end as additional demand and supply are broadly expected to balance. Over the longer term this also includes electricity displacing gas usage (for example switching to electric heating), introducing the use of green hydrogen and including more intermittent renewable generation and/or nuclear generation.\n\nPrior to the Ukraine conflict, near-term power prices across Europe were already elevated, mainly caused by increasing gas demand during 2021 and early 2022. Gas storage levels were low over the last winter period (2021/22) as electricity demand increased during 2021 as economies came out of lockdown and electricity generated from other sources, such as wind and nuclear, was lower than usual (due to unusually low wind levels and outages, respectively). This has led to European gas prices, and hence electricity prices, being more sensitive to reduced supply and/or increased demand.\n\nPower prices are one of the key risks faced by the Company: a number of factors go into power price forecasting to estimate electricity demand, including the mix of generation technology meeting this demand and for each technology, their associated costs of supply. As such, it is inherently difficult to estimate and then apply these factors to accurately forecast the outcome of this dynamic market.

The reduction in captured wholesale electricity power prices is forecast to be further impacted in each geography over time as the proportion of production coming from renewables in each market increases.\n\nThe EU markets are imposing windfall taxes via inframarginal caps applied by EU markets to each county. These materially remove the benefit of power prices in excess of a threshold (set individually by country) and this has been incorporated within the assumed power price forecasts for each affected market. Further additional legislation applicable in Spain (a gas cap and a more onerous windfall tax related to gas pricing) is also incorporated within the power price forecast assumed. Additional detail by market is included within the market background section.\n\nElectricity Generator Levy (UK-specific) The Autumn Statement in November announced the introduction of the Electricity Generator Levy to applicable UK wind and solar assets. This imposes an effective 70% tax on \u201cexcess\u201d revenues from the sale of electricity (excluding where these are derived from government support, i.e. ROCs, CfDs and FiTs). Excess revenues are defined as those above \u00a375/MWh. The 70% effective tax comprises a direct 45% levy on revenues above the threshold and 25% corporation tax as the levy is not considered a deductible expense for corporation tax. The levy is expected to be applied for 5 years from 1 January 2023 and the \u00a375 is indexed by CPI, with the first \u00a310m of \u201cexcess revenue\u201d provided as an allowance each year (i.e. escapes the levy).\n\nThe impact of the EGL is to reduce the uplift in value from increased power price forecasts. The adverse valuation impact of the introduction of the EGL has been \u00a3188.1m. It also has the effect of reducing project sensitivity to changes in power prices down to the \u00a375 threshold, as analysed in the key sensitivities section below.\n\n(ii) Movement in valuation discount rates: The weighted average portfolio valuation discount rate as at 31 December 2022 was 7.2% (31 December 2021: 6.6%). The discount rates used for valuing each investment represent an assessment of the rate of return at which it is estimated infrastructure investments with similar risk profiles would trade on the open market.\n\nDuring the year we have observed continuing strong competition for renewables infrastructure, which remains a sought-after asset class. Whilst transaction evidence is not yet demonstrating a clear increase in discount rates, the yield of long-term government bonds has increased since 30 June 2022. The Investment Manager has applied an average increase of 0.5% to discount rates across the portfolio. The valuation discount rates applied to investments in the UK have been increased by more than those in the EU, reflecting the higher long-term government bond yields in the UK.

Headline inflation figures are likely to remain high both from continued inflationary pressures (in energy and in other factors) and as a result of the \u201cbase effect\u201d, while the material increase in April will remain within the headline figure until the April 2023 inflation figure is released.\n\nInflation applied to cash flows has been uplifted for actual inflation in all geographies for the 11 months to November 2022. For December 2022 we have assumed 6% for UK RPI, 5.25% for UK CPI and 3% for CPI in the other European countries TRIG invests in.\n\nWe have shown below the revised inflation assumptions and also the effective annual rate for 2022, which combines the very high actual inflation to date with the expected inflation levels for the balance of 2022.\n\nInflation applied to future UK power prices tracks UK RPI till 2030 and is assumed to be 2.25% thereafter.\n\nInflation assumptions used in the Portfolio Valuation\n\n2022\n\nIndex\n\nForecast (Dec) full-year equivalent*\n\n2023\n\n2024-2029\n\n2030+\n\nUK RPI\n\n6.00%\n\n13.3% (December 2021: 3.75%)\n\n5.00% (December 2021: 3.50%)\n\n2.75%\n\n2.00%\n\nUK CPI\n\n5.25%\n\n10.5% (December 2021: 3.00%)\n\n4.25% (December 2021: 2.75%)\n\n2.00%\n\n2.00%\n\nUK Power Price\n\n6.00%\n\n13.3% (December 2021: 3.75%)\n\n5.00% (December 2021: 3.50%)\n\n2.75% 2.25% (December 2021: 2.75%)\n\nEurozone\n\n3.00%\n\n8.2% (December 2021: 2.00%)\n\n3.00% (December 2021: 2.00%)\n\n2.00%\n\n2.00%\n\nThis represents the average inflation across the year 2022 measured against the prior 12 months.\n\nThe inflation changes above have had the impact of increasing the valuation by \u00a3233.7m.

Hedging is also effected when making investments using the revolving credit facility by drawing in euros for euro acquisitions.\n\nThe Investment Manager keeps under review the level of euro exposure and utilises hedges, with the objective of minimising variability in shorter term cash flows with a balance between managing the sterling value of cash flow receipts and potential mark-to-market cash outflows.\n\n(vi) Balance of portfolio return: This refers to the balance of valuation movements in the year (excluding (i) to (v) above) and represents an uplift of \u00a3201.9m and a 6.4% increase over the rebased value of the portfolio. The balance of portfolio return mostly reflects the net present value of the cash flows brought forward at the prevailing portfolio discount rate (6.6% at 31 December 2021). Accounting for the fact that the acquisitions during the year occurred partway through the year and consequently these cash flows were brought forward by less than 12 months, then the increase in value would be the equivalent of an annualised rate of 6.9%.\n\n61\n\nThe majority of the Swedish wind farm income is from wholesale power sales which in the Nord Pool are denominated in euros, accordingly the investment is treated as euro-denominated.\n\n60\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\nIn addition to the unwinding of the discount rate:\n\n\u2013\n\nActual operating performance has been greater than forecast, with higher-than-forecast power prices being partially offset by lower overall generation for the year.\n\n\u2013\n\nChanges have been made to deposit rate assumptions, increasing interest rate forecasts in line with market expectations and the recent rises enacted by central banks across TRIG\u2019s markets. The portfolio has a low sensitivity to the changes in interest rates, which is an advantage to TRIG\u2019s approach of favouring long-term structured project financing rather than short-term corporate debt. Structured project financing is secured against the underlying assets, with the substantial majority benefitting from long-term interest rate swaps which fix the interest costs to the projects. As such, the overall impact of interest rate changes is not material. Please see further detail on page 157.\n\n\u2013\n\nSeveral projects secured new fixed price power purchase agreements, while others utilised existing optionality to fix some prices at attractive rates, providing additional value and revenue security.\n\nInvestment Obligations At the balance sheet date, the Company had outstanding investment commitments in relation to the construction of the Ranasj\u00f6, Salsj\u00f6 and Gr\u00f6nhult onshore wind farms, and the Cadiz solar projects (Arenosas, Malabrigo, El Yarte and Guita).\n\nThe commitment amounts below include further development and subsequent construction spend on two battery storage projects (Ryton and Drakelow).

The expected cost to build these two projects is included in Outstanding Commitments, even though contracts have not yet been entered into, given that the contracts to build these projects are expected to be signed in the short term (in 2023).\n\nTRIG has acquired the rights to develop and construct two further battery storage projects (located near Spennymoor and Drax).

This is each project\u2019s generation capacity pro-rated for TRIG\u2019s share of equity capital and subordinated debt. 4.\n\nWhere a project has been commissioned in stages, this refers to the earliest commissioning date. For construction assets, this refers to the expected completion date. Ranasj\u00f6, Salsj\u00f6, Gr\u00f6nhult and the Cadiz solar projects were under construction as at 31 December 2022. Due to contractual measures in place, TRIG does not retain any construction risk for the Cadiz solar projects, therefore they are included in the table under \u201cContracted to acquire\u201d. This is the investment commitment to acquire the Spanish solar projects. This investment is in the form of mezzanine-level bonds where the Company does not have an equity stake. The portfolio comprises five onshore wind farms in Northern France with a combined capacity of 74MW and four operational solar parks with battery storage located on the islands of Corsica and La R\u00e9union with a combined capacity of 29MW (\u201cthe Portfolio\u201d). All the Portfolio assets are backed by the French government\u2019s Feed-in Tariff subsidy and have an average year of commission of 2015. In March 2022 the Company committed to invest in a 7.8% stake in Hornsea One which completed in July 2022. In July 2022 the Company committed to invest in a further 2.4% stake in Hornsea One which completed in October 2022. In December 2022 the Company completed the acquisition of an additional 11% stake in Merkur, increasing the Company\u2019s holding from 25% to 36%.\n\n5.\n\n6. 7.\n\n8.\n\n9.\n\n66\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n3.2\n\nAnalysis of Financial\n\nResults\n\nSection NumberHeading 0\n\nSECTION 3:PERFORMANCE & RISK\n\n3.2 Analysis of Financial Results\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group had investments in 90 projects.

As an investment entity for IFRS reporting purposes, the Company carries these investments at fair value. The results below are shown on a statutory and on an \u201cexpanded\u201d basis as we have done in previous years. See the box below for further explanation.\n\nBasis of preparation In accordance with IFRS 10, the Group carries investments at fair value as the Company meets the conditions of being an Investment Entity. In addition, IFRS 10 states that investment entities should measure their subsidiaries that are themselves investment entities at fair value. Being investment entities, The Renewables Infrastructure Group (UK) Limited (\u201cTRIG UK\u201d) and The Renewables Infrastructure Group (UK) Investments Limited (\u201cTRIG UK I\u201d), the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, through which investments are purchased, are measured at fair value as opposed to being consolidated on a line-by-line basis, meaning their cash, debt and working capital balances are included as an aggregate number in the fair value of investments rather than the Group\u2019s current assets. In order to provide shareholders with more transparency into the Group\u2019s capacity for investment, ability to make distributions, operating costs and gearing levels, adjusted results have been reported in the pro forma tables below.\n\nThe pro forma tables that follow show the Group\u2019s results for the year ended 31 December 2022 and the prior year on a non-statutory \u201cExpanded basis\u201d, where TRIG UK and TRIG UK I are consolidated on a line-by-line basis, compared to the Statutory IFRS financial statements (the \u201cStatutory IFRS basis\u201d). The Directors have provided the non-statutory Expanded basis to assist users of the accounts in understanding the performance and position of the Company, by including the cash and debt balances carried in TRIG UK and TRIG UK I and expenses incurred in TRIG UK and TRIG UK I.\n\nThe necessary adjustments to get from the Statutory IFRS basis to the non-statutory Expanded basis are shown for the primary financial statements. The commentary provided on the primary statements of TRIG is on the Expanded Basis.\n\nIncome Statement The Statutory IFRS basis does not include TRIG UK and TRIG UK I\u2019s costs, such as overheads, management fees and acquisition costs against income. The Expanded basis includes the expenses incurred within TRIG UK and TRIG UK I to enable users of the accounts to fully understand the Group\u2019s costs. There is no difference in profit before tax or earnings per share between the two bases.\n\nBalance Sheet The Statutory IFRS basis includes TRIG UK and TRIG UK I\u2019s cash, debt and working capital balances as part of portfolio value. The Expanded basis shows these balances gross. There is no difference in net assets between the Statutory IFRS basis and the Expanded basis.\n\nCash Flow Statement The Statutory basis shows cash movements for the top company only (TRIG Limited). The Expanded basis shows the consolidated cash movements above the investment portfolio which are relevant to users of the accounts. Differences include income received by TRIG UK and TRIG UK I applied to reinvestment and expenses incurred by TRIG UK and TRIG UK I that are excluded under the Statutory IFRS basis.\n\nThe majority of cash generated from investments had been passed up from TRIG UK and TRIG UK I to the Company by 31 December 2022.\n\nThe purchase of investments on the Expanded basis is funded by both the company\u2019s revolving credit facility and amounts passed down after capital raises.

The valuation discount rate has also been increased in the year with the portfolio discount rate increasing to 7.2% (2021: 6.6%) reflecting increasing long-term government borrowing rates.

The facility expiry date is 31 December 2025 with options to extend for up to an additional 24 months. Margins on the facility when drawn are 1.85% over the relevant reference rate. The facility can be drawn in sterling or euros.\n\nThe revolving credit facility enables the Group to fund new acquisitions and to provide letters of credit should they be required. The facility includes a \u00a345m working capital element.\n\nThe short-term financing provided by the revolving credit facility is limited to 30% of the portfolio value. It is intended that any drawings used to finance acquisitions are repaid, in normal market conditions, within a year through equity fundraisings.\n\nThe credit facility was drawn at the commencement of the year having funded investments in 2021 and was subsequently repaid following the capital raising in March 2022. During the second half of the year further new investments were funded in addition to providing funding to the Spanish solar projects and Swedish wind projects the Group has in construction. The balance at the year end is \u00a3399m.\n\nIn addition to the revolving credit facility, the projects may have underlying project-level debt. There is an additional gearing limit in respect of such debt, which is typically non-recourse to TRIG, of 50% of the Gross Portfolio Value (being the total enterprise value of such portfolio companies), measured at the time the debt is drawn down or acquired as part of an investment. The Company may, in order to secure advantageous borrowing terms, secure a project finance facility over a group of portfolio companies.\n\nThe project-level gearing at 31 December 2022 across the portfolio was 38% (2021: 40%). Principal repayments in the year totalled \u00a3174m, as the debt is retired over the project\u2019s subsidy periods. Gearing has reduced during 2022 partially due to the scheduled repayment of debt in the year and partially due to the mix of acquisitions in the year, some of which introduced new debt in projects and some of which were acquired without project debt.\n\nThe vast majority of the project debt is fixed and has an average cost of 3.6% (including margin). The project-level debt is fully amortising and repaid in each case over the period of the subsidy term. The portfolio weighted average subsidy life remaining is 11 years.\n\nForeign Exchange Hedging At the year end, 41% of the portfolio was located within France, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden63, Germany and Spain and hence is invested in euro-denominated assets.\n\nThe Group enters into forward hedging contracts against expected income from the euro-denominated investments\u2019 distributions up to four years ahead.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06585d8f-0f97-4a7f-9dab-22f1170e89c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "06585d8f-0f97-4a7f-9dab-22f1170e89c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49f69416-8357-49ca-a1e6-2a1f9e7be413", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "6905ebc85307bbc375aa0ebd89d0e3997049b36fa2cdad7fd6ecfec60dcc1b42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8990570c-20cd-41d2-918b-d349073f16d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "b5e8ed412d1d1f2aef7e8612f07ee398f89f089845fa0f18241853dbc3288200", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5c961e4-c12f-46f5-a20e-046aafbe3816", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "59284715163e15bfb9fec274cc7e69f01e835fbb9b2ad91c10e42200f2f8b91b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "29dcc5b55acbb58d1acbc1d2d427cebea2b54313186432f39fee5b508954e84a", "text": "Gearing has reduced during 2022 partially due to the scheduled repayment of debt in the year and partially due to the mix of acquisitions in the year, some of which introduced new debt in projects and some of which were acquired without project debt.\n\nThe vast majority of the project debt is fixed and has an average cost of 3.6% (including margin).

In addition, the Group aims to enter into further forward hedging contracts such that, when combined with the \u201cincome hedges\u201d, the overall level of hedge achieved in relation to the euro-denominated assets is at least 50% of their aggregate value. The group may also make drawings under the revolving credit facility in euros, which provides further foreign exchange hedging.\n\nDuring the majority of 2022, the Group targeted hedging of approximately 60% to 80% of the overall euro portfolio value. The Group has been maintaining this increased hedging level since 2019 in light of increased euro / sterling exchange rate volatility risk related to Brexit and subsequently due to other economic factors.\n\nThe Investment Manager keeps the level of euros hedged under review, with the objective of minimising variability in shorter-term cash flows and reducing NAV volatility.

Given the stability of the Company\u2019s investment policy and focus of its strategy (i.e. investments in renewable energy infrastructure projects in the UK or Europe), the risks in the Group are not expected to change materially from quarter to quarter.

Risks relating to the Covid-19 pandemic (health and safety, energy yield, political and regulatory and taxation risks, as explained on page 77 of TRIG\u2019s Annual Report and Financial statements 2021) and risks relating to the UK\u2019s exit from the EU (\u201cBrexit\u201d) (political / regulatory and electricity pricing, as explained on page 77 of TRIG\u2019s Annual Report and Financial statements 2021) have reduced during the year. However, the exceptionally high levels of energy prices and persistently high levels of inflation across the markets the Company invests in means that the increase in regulatory and political risk last year was borne out during the year. Governments announced interventions in energy markets and introduced \u201cwindfall\u201d taxes and levies, as described in the Market Developments section on page 50. With short-to-medium term measures announced by the UK and EU, there is now a somewhat greater possibility of stability in regulation, though we consider that regulatory and political risk remains elevated due to the conflict in Ukraine leading to potential further shocks to global energy markets.\n\nThe Managers and Board discuss and consider what emerging risks there are to the Company at the board meetings. The Company has a range of advisers in addition to its Managers. These advisers report on key topics and potential events which may present potential risks that the Board and the Manager need to monitor and, where possible, mitigate. In addition, the Company and its Managers are registered with various industry bodies which alert both the Board and the Managers of emerging risks as key events and news items unfold. The inherent risk of each existing and emerging risk is assessed based on their likelihood of occurring and their potential impact should they manifest. Where necessary and possible, mitigation plans are developed to reduce the residual risk.\n\nThe Managers utilise their systems, their policies, oversight of the supply chain and third-party input to manage these risks. The strength of mitigants and controls is applied to the inherent risk to determine the residual risk, which is classified as \u2018high\u2019, \u2018medium\u2019, \u2018low\u2019 or \u2018insignificant\u2019. If a new risk arises or the likelihood of a risk occurring increases, a mitigation strategy is, where appropriate, developed and implemented together with enhanced monitoring by the Investment Manager and/or Operations Manager. The Managers review and consider the Group\u2019s key and emerging risks with the Board on a quarterly\n\nThe risks arising from these elements are embedded in risk factors already identified by the Board and the Managers. As such, the Board and the Managers have concluded that there has been no material change to the key risks or their residual risk classifications in the year.\n\nRisks identified in the Company\u2019s risk management framework This section sets out the key risks faced by the Group categorised by their residual risk rating.

For equipment manufacturers, the Company has the greatest exposures to Siemens and Vestas. If the associated contracts are priced below market levels, replacement of a counterparty may result in increases in costs to the affected portfolio companies. As a result, benchmarking of costs is an important part of pre-investment due diligence.\n\nGiven the importance of government-supported revenues for many investments in renewables, TRIG has exposure to the creditworthiness of and policy commitments by national governments and is reliant on the consistency of government policy. One example is the \u201cgrandfathering\u201d within the UK whereby renewables generators continue to receive the same level of revenue per MWh generated, set upon commissioning, for the duration of the incentive.\n\nIn addition, each project company enters into a\n\nTurbine suppliers are financially under pressure as they seek to fulfil largely fixed price supply contracts whilst being exposed to variable input costs.

These risks are included amongst other risks faced by the Group in Section 3.4 \u2013 Risks and Risk Management.\n\nAs part of being a self-managed Alternative Investment Fund, the Directors, together with the Managers, rigorously assess the risks facing the Group and consider sensitivity analysis against the principal risks identified.\n\nThe Directors have determined that the five-year period to December 2027 is an appropriate period over which to provide this viability statement as this period accords with the Group\u2019s business planning exercises and is appropriate for the investments owned by the Group. The Group\u2019s risk management processes (described in Section 3.4 \u2013 Risks and Risk Management) consider the key risks during this five-year period and beyond. These include sustainability-related risks that take into account environmental, social and governance considerations, one of which is climate change (in line with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d)).\n\nTRIG is the owner of a portfolio of project companies whose underlying assets are predominately fully constructed and operating renewable electricity generating facilities with economic lives significantly in excess of the period being considered. As a result, TRIG benefits from resilient, long-term cash flows and a set of risks that can be identified and assessed, noting that from time to time, risks may manifest that have not been anticipated. Over the next five years, 60% of portfolio revenues are fixed per MWh under government subsidies and fixed price PPAs assuming expected generation levels. Forecast revenues for wholesale power prices are based upon independent forecasts. The projects are each supported by detailed financial models. The Directors believe that diversification within the portfolio of projects (including but not limited to technologies, geographies and counterparties) helps to withstand and mitigate for risks it is most likely to meet.\n\nThe Investment Manager prepares and considers, and the Directors review, summary five-year cash flow projections each year which are refreshed quarterly as part of management reporting, business planning and dividend approval processes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48056f90-d7e8-4ce7-afa1-c5248c17bf48": {"__data__": {"id_": "48056f90-d7e8-4ce7-afa1-c5248c17bf48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49f69416-8357-49ca-a1e6-2a1f9e7be413", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "6905ebc85307bbc375aa0ebd89d0e3997049b36fa2cdad7fd6ecfec60dcc1b42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e321108-40f0-4648-9944-a932f76df264", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "0d96ddb920583d7b3dc6c2f3441d3998362304605d7c8d12fa5e4fd473c4621e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "efb2ade5-d980-419c-9de1-8e5486f4e14c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "935d45c05072ea0c3986f0a27ee58d822fe02bf972801b60788295f9c1de01d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "6443759142236d0564ba8d38e1ce806de92c364cbf4302f70d7dc238c2224880", "text": "As a result, TRIG benefits from resilient, long-term cash flows and a set of risks that can be identified and assessed, noting that from time to time, risks may manifest that have not been anticipated.

Forecast revenues for wholesale power prices are based upon independent forecasts. The projects are each supported by detailed financial models. The Directors believe that diversification within the portfolio of projects (including but not limited to technologies, geographies and counterparties) helps to withstand and mitigate for risks it is most likely to meet.\n\nThe Investment Manager prepares and considers, and the Directors review, summary five-year cash flow projections each year which are refreshed quarterly as part of management reporting, business planning and dividend approval processes. The projections consider cash balances and liquidity, key covenants and limits, dividend cover, investment policy compliance and other key financial indicators over the five-year period. Sensitivity analysis considers the potential impact of the Group\u2019s principal risks occurring (individually and together). These projections are based on the Managers\u2019 expectations of future asset performance, income and costs, and are consistent with the methodology applied to produce the valuation of the investments.\n\nThe Directors review significant changes to the Company\u2019s cash projections each quarter with the Managers as part of the quarterly Board meetings. The viability assessment assumes continued government support for existing subsidy arrangements other than where the French Republic has been seeking to retrospectively reduce certain historical, contracted Feed-in Tariffs for early solar PV plants. Generally, subsidy payments, which comprise an important element of the Group\u2019s revenues alongside electricity sales into the wholesale market, are considered to be robust as Governments continue to support the transition towards renewable energy generation. Subsidy earnings are spread across several jurisdictions (currently UK, Ireland, Germany and France) where it is expected that governments will act consistently with their promises, especially in a sector which continues to need to mobilise large amounts of capital. In the case of France, the government stated the adjustments they are seeking to implement (referred to above) are limited to the older solar projects, which were awarded tariffs under legislation from 2010 or earlier.\n\nThe Directors believe that whilst the risk to the value of the Company\u2019s investments, its ability to operate its projects and generate revenue presented by the current environment is significant (such as recovery from Covid-19, rising inflation and interest rates, the Ukraine conflict, regulatory change and global supply chain issues), there has been limited disruption to the business to date and the risk-mitigating activities have served to reduce the impact. The Directors continue to work with the Managers to ensure that the portfolio of investments are able to operate as effectively as possible. The Managers have performed downside risk scenario planning encompassing a range of potential outcomes and these demonstrate that whilst profitability may be adversely affected, the Company and its investments are expected to remain viable.\n\nThe Company has assessed its resilience over the five-year period against severe, albeit plausible, individual and combined stress scenarios covering principal risks the Company faces.\n\nOf the principal risks, the Directors consider the most significant risk affecting financial resilience to be the level of achieved power price income (albeit these are currently high versus historical norms and expected to remain elevated in the near to medium term).\n\n82\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\nThe investments in renewable energy projects held by the Company generally have low operating costs as a proportion of expected income and so a significant reduction in revenues can be sustained which, whilst reducing income available to pass up to the Company including that available to pay dividends, would not be expected to threaten solvency. Where the investments have long-term debt financing in place, repayments of principal debt are substantially covered by projected revenues arising from subsidies and other fixed price income (per unit of power generated). This assumes normal levels of generation.

Due to the low operating costs and that the long-term fixed rate project-level debt is expected to be covered by the subsidy streams that would continue to be paid, this scenario showed the investments continued to be solvent and able to pass up distributions to the Company. The cash available to the company to pay dividends and to reinvest would be reduced significantly such that if dividends were not reduced, the dividend coverage would reduce to c. 1x and hence the current level of dividend might not be sustained. However, dividends are discretionary and hence solvency and resilience in this scenario are maintained.\n\nThe Company takes an average of three power price forecasters\u2019 central cases to include in its valuation to estimate future market prices. Forecasters include both high and low cases in their forecasts. A reduction of power prices by half is below the forecasters\u2019 low case scenarios. The probability attached to power prices being lower than the forecasters\u2019 low cases would typically be estimated by forecasters to be below 10%, suggesting this would be an unlikely downside case.\n\nLess severe downside cases were run assuming 10% lower power price projections compared to the central case, reduced generation levels assuming a P90 case (see Note 4 in the Financial Statements) and a combination of these scenarios were assessed. In all scenarios including the combined downside case, the company remained solvent and could continue to pay dividends at current levels.\n\nTRIG has a revolving credit facility (\u201cRCF\u201d) at fund level which was increased and extended to \u00a3750m on 3 February 2023. This facility has a three-year term and expires on 31 December 2025. The company uses the proceeds from equity fund raises to repay the RCF as well as operational cash from investments. Projected reinvestment flows over the next five years continue to be healthy (\u00a388m of reinvestment was achieved in 202265). In the event that equity fund raises and reinvestment are not sufficient to repay the RCF balance by the expiry date, the Company would anticipate either renewing the RCF and/or raising new debt to repay that balance secured against ungeared projects within the portfolio (that represent 37% of the portfolio by value) and/or strategic disposals or a combination of all three activities.\n\n63% by value of the renewable energy projects TRIG owns have long-term, fixed-rate, amortising senior debt in place. These projects do not need to be refinanced and the debt within these projects is scheduled to be repaid, in the main, from expected revenues arising from subsidies and fixed-price PPAs over the term of that fixed-price-per-MWh income. 37% by value of the renewable energy projects TRIG owns are ungeared.\n\nThe Company\u2019s dividend policy is to increase the dividend when the Board considers it prudent to do so, considering forecast cash flows, expected dividend cover, inflation across TRIG\u2019s key markets, the outlook for electricity prices and the operational performance of the Company\u2019s portfolio. Dividends are discretionary and declared quarterly. Each year, as the target dividend for the next financial year is set, the Directors consider the expected forward-looking cash flows and consider the sustainability of the proposed dividend.

In light of the FRC\u2019s \u201cCRR Thematic review of TCFD disclosures and climate in the financial statements\u201d published in July 2022, published in July 2022, we consider ourselves to be consistent in our reporting against ten of the eleven TCFD recommendations (as published in June 2017 by the TCFD). For recommendation ten, TRIG currently reports its Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the 2022 calendar year and will be publishing its Scope 3 emissions in the Company\u2019s 2023 Sustainability Report. This is due to the complexities of collecting and analysing scope 3 emissions data. Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are reported for the 2021 calendar year.

The Board has overall responsibility for the oversight of TRIG\u2019s sustainability risks and opportunities, of which climate change is an important subset. As is set out in TRIG\u2019s Sustainability Policy, which is available on TRIG\u2019s website. The TRIG Board has extensive experience in the renewables sector, as shown in Section 4.1 \u2013 Board of Directors, and receive training on sustainability and ESG, to facilitate further understanding of the climate risks and opportunities faced by the Company. The Board and Managers discuss risks related to climate change at least annually and have ultimate oversight of the Company\u2019s risk management framework. Consideration of the transition risks and physical consequences of climate change features in the Board\u2019s discussions. Climate change is also considered within the Company\u2019s risk register at each Board meeting. The Board considers climate-related events through its discussions with the Managers, notably in respect of opportunities through the Company\u2019s annual strategy reviews and risks through the Company\u2019s risk management framework which is presented in Section 3.4 \u2013 Risks and Risk management, on page 75. The Board\u2019s Audit Committee considers the Company\u2019s climate-related disclosures, and the Board\u2019s Management Engagement Committee reviews the Managers\u2019 performance annually, including their adherence to the Company\u2019s Sustainability Policy.\n\n2 Describe\n\nmanagement\u2019s role in assessing and managing climate- related risks and opportunities\n\nTRIG\u2019s Sustainability Policy, including climate change considerations, applies to both making new investments (throughout the deal screening and due diligence processes) and running of the current portfolio (asset management activities, monitoring and reporting).

Detail on both organisations, including their commitments to addressing climate change can be found in Section 2.1, on page 18, and throughout Section 2.4. The Managers monitor climate- related government policy, engaging with policy makers where appropriate, and physical changes in the climate, to inform the application of TRIG\u2019s strategy and the Managers\u2019 assessment of the risks faced by the Company.

InfraRed and RES each report on their sustainability-related activities, including relating to climate change. Their reporting is available on their respective websites. RES and/or InfraRed are represented on the board of each project company. Through this role, they ensure that climate change-related risks are considered by project company management teams and reflected in project company risk registers.

The Company defines short term as 5 years from the date of this report aligning with the Company\u2019s viability statement, medium term as 15 years from the date of this report, aligning to the typical length of government-backed revenue support mechanisms, and long term as 30 years from the date of this report, aligning with the typical life of a renewables infrastructure asset. The pace of the transition to a net zero carbon future will dictate the size of the investment opportunity for TRIG. Under current plans for renewables deployment spread over the range of European countries in which TRIG invests, coupled with the expected need for the replacement of existing installations in due course, as well as supporting infrastructure, the Managers expect there to be significant investment opportunities for the Company over the long term. This is further expanded upon in response to recommendation four. Notwithstanding this, TRIG recognises that risks relating to climate change could have an impact on the Company. How these risks are identified is described overleaf under recommendation six and the risks identified are explored later in the scenario analysis relating to recommendation five.\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n85\n\n3.6 Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures (continued)\n\nStrategy\n\nRecommendation\n\nDisclosure\n\n4\n\nDescribe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation\u2019s businesses, strategy and financial planning\n\nThe table below sets out key climate-related opportunities and risks as they apply to TRIG, identified using the approach outlined in recommendation six. Risks arising from climate change overlap with the Company\u2019s principal risks: energy yield, energy pricing and government / regulations. These principal risks are covered in more detail on page 75 of this Annual Report.

An increase in renewables build-out ambition without sufficient demand-side action can reduce power price forecasts. In the medium and longer term there is a risk that developments in renewables and other clean generation technologies result in unforeseen changes in wholesale power prices, due to either changes in the marginal cost of generation which sets prices or policy changes to the system for setting prices. This is reflected in the Company\u2019s principal risk reporting in Section 3.4 \u2013 Risks and Risk Management. Climate change means that portfolio investments will likely be exposed to more frequent extreme weather events over time, particularly those in countries most affected by climate risk, increasing the risk of physical damage to on- site infrastructure and off-site transmission and distribution systems, alongside additional safety risks and operational considerations. Such events may be acute, including: \u25b2 Forest, grassland or peat fires; \u25b2 Flooding; or \u25b2 Storms and high-speed wind gusts or chronic, including: \u25b2 Increased temperatures such that the thermal capacity\n\nof equipment could be exceeded;\n\n\u25b2 Changes to ground conditions from increased rain; or \u25b2 Changes to cloud cover impacting ground-level solar\n\nirradiation.\n\nRisks also include potential long-term changes to weather patterns causing a material increase or decrease in an asset\u2019s energy yield from that expected at the time of investment. Mitigation comes from portfolio diversification across geographies and technologies. This reduces the overall impact of action taken by an individual government, of any local extreme weather event or of any single asset failure.

This has resulted in significant growth in markets where TRIG has an investment focus. In the near term, the greatest investment activity in TRIG\u2019s key markets is expected to be from subsidised offshore wind in the North Sea and onshore wind in France, and unsubsidised onshore wind in the UK and Nordics and solar in Iberia.\n\nThe geographies and technologies within the portfolio are likely to increase as the Investment Manager, InfraRed, also considers a broader range of investment opportunities within the Company\u2019s investment remit.\n\nEconomics are pushing projects to greater scale, which may result in fewer opportunities by number.

This provides the opportunity to reduce the margin and commitment fees under the facility should TRIG meet certain targets, including increasing the number of homes powered by clean energy from TRIG\u2019s portfolio.\n\nIncreasing penetration of intermittent renewable electricity generators in the energy system risks increasing the volatility in the prevailing and forecast power price. In the near term, exposure is reduced through managing the proportion of revenues with fixed power prices, achieved through the acquisition of investments with subsidised revenues, fixing under offtake agreements and the use of hedging instruments. Forecasted revenues are budgeted based on estimates of energy yield from individual projects. The accuracy of these budgets are subject to risks relating to generation including equipment downtime and low weather resource. In the medium term, the build-out of long-term storage infrastructure, charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and grid upgrades will help provide flexibility to the energy system. This will support the power price at times when renewables generation may exceed electricity demand, thereby reducing periods of low or negative pricing. Climate change is considered in the valuation of the Company\u2019s investments. For example, cannibalisation is applied to power price assumptions, accounting for the effect that renewables can have on overall power prices.

This assessment covers the whole of TRIG\u2019s portfolio and considers the physical impacts over the short, medium and long-term periods based on different climate scenarios.\n\nadjusted differently to arrive at either a high transition risk scenario or a high physical risk scenario. These scenarios could be arrived at through a number of different paths. It is not necessarily the case, for instance, that in a high transition risk scenario that forecast power prices may be lower; greater than expected demand, public policy or a market \u201cpremium\u201d on renewable electricity could result in power prices at a higher level than those we assume in the high transition risk scenario.\n\nCurrent long-term power price forecasts do not assume that climate change is limited to 1.5-2 degrees and also do not correspond with a 4-degree temperature change scenario (as referenced in the next TCFD consideration, the high physical risk scenario).\n\nEqually, it is not necessarily the case that in the high physical risk scenario that power prices would increase relative to a high transition risk scenario; for instance, electricity demand and commodity prices may be lower than forecast.\n\nTherefore, to assess the potential impact from climate change on power prices, net zero versions of power price forecasters were used across TRIG\u2019s portfolio to estimate the impact of a high transition risk scenario on TRIG\u2019s portfolio. Similarly for the higher physical risk scenario, the current energy mix is assumed to stay static as this is estimated to equate to a 4-degree temperature change \u2013 all else being equal. It is important to note that these forecasts are incredibly complex, with a very large number of inputs that could be\n\nEstimates are provided below of the potential financial impact of two climate change scenarios. Neither of the two scenarios are considered as representing an indication of current fair value for the portfolio, as the assumptions applied are for more extreme climate scenarios.

This impact could be reduced as a result of industry efficiencies, such as lower operating costs arising from greater competition between sub-contractors as the sector continues to scale up, or increased generation efficiencies and performance.\n\nOne of the challenges to achieving more renewables build-out than assumed in current power price forecasts, and therefore decarbonisation, is that as long-term power prices fall, a feedback loop of making fewer new projects financially viable is created, which in turn reduces the rollout rate and therefore reduces the downward pressure on forecast power prices.\n\n\u25b2 An increase in carbon prices is expected;

It is expected that these events could occur over an 5\u201315-year time period.\n\nA key mitigant to the portfolio as a whole suffering from a material event at any one asset is the portfolio\u2019s asset diversification including the geographic spread across six European countries, which helps to reduce the impact of localised weather events.\n\nWhilst current power price forecasts are not prepared on the basis of an overall temperature change, the underlying assumptions, particularly relating to renewables build-out, are consistent with a 3 degree Celsius scenario.\n\nThe Managers have undertaken in-house analysis, using the same approach as that of the high transition risk analysis, to consider the potential physical impact of climate change on TRIG\u2019s portfolio over a variety of scenarios.\n\nChronic changes refer to long-term and structural physical risks. Acute changes refer to the increased risk of specific, extreme short-term events. How events are categorised under these two headings is set out in the subsequent table. The review suggests a possible adverse impact of physical risks in a high temperature change scenario of c. 2p to 3p per share. The estimated financial impact does not consider the offsetting impact of any insurance claims that may be possible.\n\nSustainability considerations, including those relating to climate change, are integrated throughout InfraRed\u2019s investment process, for example a climate change risk assessment must be completed for all new investments.

In such a scenario, it is likely that the renewables rollout assumptions incorporated in current power price forecasts are unlikely to be met. The current energy mix across Europe broadly equates to a 4 degree temperature change and therefore the current power price assumptions from 2024 (upon normalisation of forecast power prices from current elevated levels) is applied across the forecast period as an approximation.\n\nIn such a scenario, it is likely that the renewables rollout assumptions incorporated in current power price forecasts are unlikely to be met.

Dry peat can also have a higher exposure risk to fire.\n\n\u25b2 Some habitat management plans include maintained firebreaks in accordance with site risk assessments.\n\n\u25b2 Monoculture forestry is removed from the immediate vicinity of each wind turbine to provide sufficient space during turbine erection, which provides a degree of protection from fire.\n\nFire\n\n\u25b2 Some sites have wider forestry removal to improve energy yield performance which can be coupled with broadleaf compensatory planting elsewhere.\n\nExposure to icing changes as humidity levels increase in those areas previously less affected by icing.

Nonetheless, climate-related risks exist and are identified and discussed through the Managers\u2019 wider risk management processes outlined on page 75. They are identified and assessed by the Managers when making new investments (throughout the deal screening and due diligence processes) and in the running of the current portfolio (asset management activities, monitoring and reporting).\n\nThe Company has appointed a third-party consultant to model and identify further climate- related risks with findings reviewed by the Managers and Board to consider mitigations. As part of this process, each asset has been screened according to specific location and key technology characteristics. The assessment details the probability of an asset being exposed to climate hazards at varying levels of intensity, such as extreme winds of a particular speed, or floods of certain depths \u2013 using the latest climate scenarios (SSP-8.5/RCP-8.5; SSP2-4.5/RCP-4.5; SSP1-2.6/RCP-2.6). This will allow TRIG to quantify the climate hazards\u2019 characteristics likely to cause direct damage or disruption to each asset in order to calculate the value at risk for the portfolio. The results of this climate assessment will be published in TRIG\u2019s 2023 Sustainability Report.\n\n7 Describe the organisation\u2019s processes for managing climate-related risks\n\nClimate-related risks identified through the acquisition process are managed through the acquisition business plan and investment pricing. The appropriateness of mitigating action is considered by the Investment Committee as part of the investment process. Representatives of RES and/or InfraRed sit on the board of each project company.\n\nThrough this role, they ensure that climate change-related risks are considered by project company management teams, reflected in project company risk registers and appropriate mitigation plans are put in place.

Outside of this, as an organisation which invests solely in infrastructure that contributes towards a net-zero carbon future, TRIG utilises a range of metrics which monitor the portfolio\u2019s contribution to mitigating climate change, including the following, with the latest figures reported on page 39:\n\n\u25b2 Renewable energy generation\n\n\u25b2 Tonnes of carbon emissions avoided\n\n\u25b2 Homes powered by clean energy, which impacts the margin and commitment fee paid\n\nunder TRIG\u2019s ESG-linked revolving credit facility\n\n\u25b2 The proportion of portfolio sourcing electricity under renewable energy tariffs\n\n\u25b2 Number of active environmental management projects\n\nThe Board and Managers consider several metrics that relate to climate-related opportunities and risks: \u25b2 Renewables build-out assumptions in TRIG\u2019s investment and target acquisition markets,\n\nwhich impacts long-term power price forecast assumptions\n\n\u25b2 Percentage of revenues with fixed power prices, which impacts the extent to which\n\nfluctuations in power price forecasts affects the portfolio valuation and forecast cash flows\n\n\u25b2 Energy yield, where deviations from expectations are examined for climate-related risk\n\nfactors, including those arising from asset availability\n\nThe Company\u2019s annual budgeting and semi-annual valuation process includes forecasts that may be influenced by the transition and physical impacts of climate change.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f9da49b-daef-457e-b11a-be7639e1ce62": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f9da49b-daef-457e-b11a-be7639e1ce62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49f69416-8357-49ca-a1e6-2a1f9e7be413", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "6905ebc85307bbc375aa0ebd89d0e3997049b36fa2cdad7fd6ecfec60dcc1b42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3d93d97-9f51-4545-9aef-399c9c6937a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "bd4f11c72aab09080f86eb977780a4987f21493a1a27e9605c78fc51df7d1a53", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4cb7de0b-f277-4b2c-a02e-ecb0179ff25e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "429de661a25c9726452d826a7379dde06e201eaa6bb54eb60f9413f81f76f4a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "faf0f6c5159ffb4bad49b9261154b22e6b4bd93b0ebd5f7a9e2801f66038b7fa", "text": "These include expectations in respect of variables, in particular:\n\n\u25b2 Percentage of revenues with fixed power prices, which impacts the extent to which\n\nfluctuations in power price forecasts affects the portfolio valuation and forecast cash flows\n\n\u25b2 Energy yield, where deviations from expectations are examined for climate-related risk\n\nfactors, including those arising from asset availability\n\nDeviations of these variables from budgets and changes to the variables in forecasts may serve as leading indicators of changes to climate-related opportunities, risks and performance.\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n93\n\n3.6 Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures (continued)\n\nMetrics\n\nRecommendation\n\nDisclosure\n\n10 Disclose Scope\n\n1, Scope 2, and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions and the related risks\n\nThe Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol categorises greenhouse gas emissions into three groups, or \u201cscopes\u201d: Scope 1 covers direct emissions from owned/controlled sources; Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by the company; and Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur in the Company\u2019s value chain.\n\nTRIG\u2019s Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are disclosed below. TRIG has adopted the operational control boundary approach for the measurement of energy emissions for TRIG projects, as the Directors believe this reflects the level of emissions that can be actively controlled and reduced.\n\nGoing forward TRIG may alter its methodology to align with the definition of a \u2018financial institution\u2019 as defined by the GHG Reporting Protocols and SBTi. This would impact the presentation of the Company\u2019s GHG emissions, resulting in a greater proportion of emissions falling under Scope 3. An update on this will be provided in TRIG\u2019s 2023 Sustainability Report.\n\nEmissions have been calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Location-based emission factors have been updated and are calculated using International Energy Agency (IEA) emission factors, to maintain consistency between regional investments. The 2021 location-based emissions have been reinstated to reflect these revised emissions factors in order to compare on a like for like basis.\n\nOverall, there has been a decrease in reported emissions from 2021 to 2022, which was largely due to a reduction in the amount of energy purchased by the projects. Other contributing factors were an improvement in data collected from the underlying investments and a slight increase in projects which have green energy tariffs (72% to 75% as reported on page 40).\n\nYear ended\n\nYear ended\n\nDisclosure\n\n31 December 2021\n\n31 December 2022\n\nScope 1 \u2013 direct emissions (tCO2e)\n\n18\n\n54\n\nScope 2 \u2013 indirect emissions, market based (tCO2e)\n\n969\n\n308\n\nTotal Scope 1 and 2 (market based) emissions (tCO2e)\n\n987\n\n363\n\nIntensity ratio (tCO2e per MWh of renewable electricity generated)\n\n0.0005\n\n0.0002\n\nWeighted average carbon intensity (tCO2e / \u00a3m)\n\n1.84\n\n0.41\n\nScope 2 \u2013 indirect emissions, location based (tCO2e)\n\n1,362\n\n575\n\nScope 3 \u2013 indirect emissions within Company value chain (tCO2e)\n\n317,778\n\nScope 3 emissions for 2022 will be published in in TRIG\u2019s 2023 Sustainability Report\n\nTotal Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (tCO2e)\n\n318,765\n\nScope 3 emissions for 2022 will be published in TRIG\u2019s 2023 Sustainability Report\n\nThe Managers have been seeking to understand and quantify the usage of other greenhouse gases, such as SF6, across the portfolio.

The Board delegates certain activities, including day-to-day investment management and operations management, and works closely with all key service providers. Shareholder interaction is regarded as a critical component of the management of TRIG and the Board works closely with the Managers, InfraRed and RES, with the Company Secretary, Aztec and with the Company\u2019s brokers, Investec and BNP Paribas, to keep abreast of the needs and concerns of shareholders.\n\nCorporate-level suppliers: As well as the critical day-to-day oversight of the portfolio provided by InfraRed and RES, TRIG has a set of corporate providers which ensure the smooth running of the Company. In administration, Aztec provides consistent support for corporate and company secretarial activities, while Investec and BNP Paribas act as key intermediaries between the Company and its shareholder base, working with the Managers to arrange meetings with current and prospective investors, monitoring equity market conditions and advising on capital raising activities.\n\n106\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n(continued)\n\nSection NumberHeading 0\n\nSECTION 4: DIRECTORS\u2019 REPORT\n\nTRIG benefits from the commitment and flexibility of six corporate lenders for the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility, namely National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland International, ING, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Barclays, Lloyds, BNP Paribas, ABN Amro, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) and Intesa SanPaolo. Carey Olsen and Norton Rose Fulbright provide corporate legal support for the business in Guernsey and London, respectively, and tax services are provided by KPMG.

The Company\u2019s auditor is Deloitte. Additional independent valuation services are provided by the accountants BDO from time to time. The Company also receives a range of other services, including shareholder list analysis, webhosting, design and remuneration consulting.\n\nOperational partners: TRIG benefits from co-investing alongside several joint venture partners, some being developers and vendors, such as Equinor, Orsted, SSE and Akuo Energy and others being financial co-investment partners, for example APG and Equitix. In each case, the Managers build on the relationship with the co-investor, providing representatives to attend project board meetings to coordinate and monitor the investment, with the additional potential to share best practices.\n\nVendors: TRIG\u2019s reputation for reliability and efficiency in transaction management with a variety of vendor counterparties helps the Company to continue to derive value in origination by accessing projects off-market (including from RES itself under the right of first offer agreement).\n\nPortfolio Customers: As an energy provider, TRIG\u2019s key customers are PPA counterparties. These offtakers pay for and receive TRIG\u2019s portfolio companies\u2019 output \u2013 with revenues being payments for the renewables benefits as well as commercial power for those projects permitted to receive power market revenues.\n\nPortfolio Suppliers: TRIG\u2019s key operational suppliers include Original Equipment Manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), spare part O&M providers and increasingly Independent Service Providers (\u201cISPs\u201d). On construction projects the key suppliers are the EPC contractors, turbine suppliers and balance of plant contractors. Utilities also provide certain site-specific services such as meter readings. The operations teams maintain relationships with the site landowners who receive rental payments. Lenders to the project companies include many leading domestic and international banking groups. TRIG\u2019s Managers maintain discussions with key lenders as there are opportunities to refinance projects as market conditions allow, and this has been done selectively within the portfolio to date.\n\nLocal Communities: TRIG is conscious of its role in the local communities in which its projects operate. Close consultation with local planning authorities is an important feature of renewables whether in construction, during operations or preparing for the potential repowering or dismantling of a project. Socially, TRIG seeks to provide educational events at its larger sites, while also contributing via community funds to local projects ranging from playgroups to cultural events.\n\nEconomic activities around the sites provide additional demand for local goods and services as well as local employment opportunities, for example in the maintenance of the sites and access. These are particularly valued in areas where a long-term urbanisation trend has resulted in reduction in the local rural economies.\n\nTRIG seeks to promote best practices across the portfolio, in areas such as noise monitoring, shadow flicker, ice throw, landscaping, the provision of community events and liaison with the local media.\n\nFurther details on how TRIG interacts with the local community can be found in Section 2.5 \u2013 Sustainability.\n\nOther External Stakeholders: The Company maintains a close dialogue, through its Managers, with key regulators as well as with the regulated networks, such as National Grid and the relevant network operators in the UK. At a policy level, TRIG\u2019s Managers monitor requirements and engage with key government departments and regulatory bodies.

The Board has put in place a framework for corporate governance which it believes is appropriate for an investment company in line with the best practices in relation to matters affecting shareholders, communities, regulators and other stakeholders of the Company. With a range of relevant skills and experience, all Directors contribute to the Board discussions and debates on corporate governance. In particular, the Board believes in providing as much transparency for investors as is reasonably possible to ensure investors can clearly understand the prospects of the business and enhance liquidity of its shares whilst also preserving an appropriate level of commercial confidentiality.\n\nGuernsey Regulatory Environment The Guernsey Financial Services Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) issued a Finance Sector Code of Corporate Governance. The Code comprises Principles and Guidance and provides a formal expression of good corporate practice against which shareholders, boards and the Commission can better assess the governance exercised over companies in Guernsey\u2019s finance sector.\n\nThe Commission recognises that the different nature, scale and complexity of specific businesses will lead to differing approaches to meeting the Code. Companies which report against the UK Corporate Governance Code or the AIC Code are also deemed to meet this code. The Directors have determined that the Company will continue as a Guernsey-registered closed-ended investment company.\n\nAIFM Directive The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive seeks to regulate alternative investment fund managers (in this paragraph, \u201cAIFM\u201d) and imposes obligations on managers who manage alternative investment funds (in this paragraph, \u201cAIF\u201d) in the EU or who market shares in such funds to EU investors. The Company is categorised as a self-managed Non-EEA AIF for the purposes of the AIFM Directive. In order to maintain compliance with the AIFM Directive, the Company needs to comply with various organisational, operational and transparency obligations.\n\nNon-Mainstream Pooled Investments On 1 January 2014, certain changes to the FCA rules relating to restrictions on the retail distribution of unregulated collective investment schemes and close substitutes came into effect.\n\nAs announced by the Company on 7 January 2014, following the receipt of legal advice the Board confirms that it conducts the Company\u2019s affairs, and intends to continue to conduct the Company\u2019s affairs, such that the Company would qualify for approval as an investment trust if it were resident in the United Kingdom. It is the Board\u2019s intention that the Company will continue to conduct its affairs in such a manner and that Independent Financial Advisers should therefore be able to recommend its Ordinary Shares to ordinary retail investors in accordance with the FCA\u2019s rules relating to non-mainstream investment products.\n\nAIC Code The Board of TRIG has considered the Principles and Provisions of the AIC Code of Corporate Governance (AIC Code). The AIC Code addresses the Principles and Provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the UK Code), as well as setting out additional provisions on issues that are of specific relevance to investment companies. The Board considers that reporting against the Principles and Provisions of the AIC Code, which has been endorsed by the Financial Reporting Council and the Guernsey Financial Services Commission, provides more relevant information to shareholders. The company has complied with the Principles and Provisions of the AIC Code. The AIC Code is available on the AIC website (www.theaic.co.uk). It includes an explanation of how the AIC Code adapts the Principles and Provisions set out in the UK Code to make them relevant for investment companies.\n\nThe Board The Board consists of five non-executive Directors.

The AIC Code is available on the AIC website (www.theaic.co.uk). It includes an explanation of how the AIC Code adapts the Principles and Provisions set out in the UK Code to make them relevant for investment companies.\n\nThe Board The Board consists of five non-executive Directors. In accordance with Provision 10 of the AIC Code, all of the non-executives are independent of the Investment Manager. The Chairman, Richard Morse, met the independence criteria of the AIC Code Provision 11 upon appointment and continues to meet this condition throughout his term of service. Although not a requirement of the AIC Code, in accordance with guidance in Provision 11, the Board has a Senior Independent Director, Tove Feld, who was appointed as Senior Independent Director in 2022. Being non- executive Directors, none of the Directors have a service contract with the Company.\n\nStewardship Code The Company\u2019s Managers are responsible for day-to-day management of the portfolio and therefore are best placed to engage with portfolio companies and discharge stewardship obligations. Accordingly, TRIG becoming a signatory to the Stewardship Code would unnecessarily duplicate the work of the Managers.\n\nThe Articles of Incorporation provide that each of the Directors shall retire at each Annual General Meeting in accordance with Provision 23 of the AIC Code. All Directors intend to retire and offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting on May 2023, other than Klaus Hammer who intends to retire from his role on the TRIG Board during 2023. Selina Sagayam will be standing for election.\n\nThe Board has instead chosen to exercise stewardship by reporting against the AIC Code rather than by being signatories to the Stewardship Code.\n\n110\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\nThe Board believes that the balance of skills, gender, experience, ethnicity and knowledge of the current Board provides for a sound base from which the interests of investors will be served to a high standard. As reported in Section 4.1 \u2013 Board of Directors, the Board\u2019s Nomination Committee has completed its succession plan for Helen Mahy, Shelagh Mason, Jon Bridel (each joining the Board in 2013) and Klaus Hammer (who joined the Board in 2014) with the appointments of John Whittle (in 2021), Erna-Maria Trixl, Richard Morse (each in 2022) and Selina Sagayam (who will join the Board in 2023).\n\nThe Nomination Committee is mindful of the recommendations of the Hampton Alexander Review on gender diversity and the Parker Review on ethnic diversity, and the requirements of the FCA\u2019s policy statement on diversity and inclusion on company boards and executive management. Following the conclusion of the Nomination Committee\u2019s succession plan, with the retirement\n\nof Klaus Hammer from the Board and the appointment of Selina Sagayam, the composition of the Board of Directors will be aligned with each of these frameworks.\n\nThe Board recommends the re-election of each Director and supporting biographies are disclosed in Section 4.1 (page 102) of this annual report.\n\nThe Board is scheduled to meet at least four times a year and between these formal meetings there is regular contact with the Investment Manager and Operations Manager, the Secretary and the Company\u2019s Joint Brokers. The Directors are kept fully informed of investment and financial controls, and other matters that are relevant to the business of the Company that should be brought to the attention of the Directors. The Directors also have access, where necessary in the furtherance of their duties, to independent professional advice at the expense of the Company.\n\nThe attendance record of Directors for the period to 31 December 2022 is set out below:\n\nQuarterly Board meetings\n\nAudit Committee\n\nManagement Engagement Committee\n\nRemuneration Committee\n\nNomination Committee\n\nMarket Disclosure Committee\n\nNumber of meetings*\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nMeetings Attended:\n\nH Mahy (resigned 31 Oct)\n\n3\n\nN/A**\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\nJ Bridel (resigned 27 May)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\nS Mason (resigned 28 Feb)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nK Hammer\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nT Feld\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nJ Whittle\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nR Morse (appointed 18 July)\n\n2\n\nN/A**\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\nE-M Trixl (appointed 1 March)\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nEvery Director was present for every meeting available for them to attend.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fd7d44e-0a5c-430b-9dec-fcfbf76970d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fd7d44e-0a5c-430b-9dec-fcfbf76970d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49f69416-8357-49ca-a1e6-2a1f9e7be413", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "6905ebc85307bbc375aa0ebd89d0e3997049b36fa2cdad7fd6ecfec60dcc1b42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "28d44788-f93c-4ac6-a544-3b8888c305a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "7420cb8e161a5397ba6a20b89213dfc140184082eafa6f3c60b1caeb40911739", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5808244-0b2e-498c-9b3d-e55794df96be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "0a6b5f7a0fb47bebb4f6c1b955f58bf7816b49fdf07fe4097853e3017f1200a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "f76c3f3c65c133f893c054815b8424007402ea42b56bd3bbf057d70bf68f87d1", "text": "Some Directors served part but not all of the year and hence attended meetings for part but not all of the year.\n\n**Helen Mahy and Richard Morse were not members of the Audit Committee during 2022 and attended only at the invitation of the Committee\n\nDuring the period a further 28 ad hoc Board/Committee meetings were held in Guernsey to deal with matters substantially of an administrative nature and these were attended by those Directors available.\n\nwith the Investment Manager.

The investment strategy is reviewed regularly\n\nThe Board and the governance arrangements continued to operate effectively during 2022.\n\nPerformance Evaluation The Board evaluates its performance and considers the tenure and independence of each Director on an annual basis. The Board also employs an independent adviser to conduct a formal evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board with a frequency of at least once every three years. During the year, such a formal evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board was carried out by BoardAlpha Limited, an independent consultant.

The report commented that the Board has a tight grasp of strategic issues, with a strong level of involvement, and provides constructive challenges to the Managers. Through detailed reporting from the Managers, the Board has excellent oversight of the portfolio, operations and investing activity and has a strong drive to protect shareholder interests. Board members were considered to be well prepared for meetings, and effective and professional in their decision- making and boardroom behaviour. BoardAlpha noted that the Company\u2019s Board had undergone a significant degree of evolution recently and that the transition of the Board\u2019s membership appeared to have been smooth and with good handover periods. Overall, BoardAlpha concluded that the Board worked well with the Managers, Company Secretary and other service providers and demonstrated a high standard of corporate governance. A number of useful recommendations of an administrative nature were made by BoardAlpha that the Company has taken on board.\n\nGiven responsible investment considerations are at the heart of the Company\u2019s strategy, the Board will be establishing a further committee to specifically considering ESG and Sustainability. As the Company grows in size and complexity, it is considered that the formation of this committee will provide more focused consideration of these important topics.\n\nThe Directors engage with the senior leadership of both Managers to understand succession planning at each of the Managers\u2019 organisations. Towards the end of 2022, there was also an increase in the contact between the Board and the day-to-day management team of TRIG to delve into specific matters in more detail as required and leverage the particular skill set of individual Board members, as well as help utilise the time at Board meetings most effectively as the Company continues to grow in complexity.\n\nThe independence of each Director has been considered and each has been confirmed as being independent of the Company and its Managers. The Board believes that the composition of the Board and its Committees reflect a suitable mix of skills and experience, and that the Board, as a whole, and its Committees functioned effectively during 2022 and since the launch of the Company in 2013.\n\nThe Board continues to monitor training for Directors. The Directors consider and regularly report their training needs and continuing professional development and training carried out. For example, during the year, the Directors attended courses on relevant subjects including cyber security, risk management, tax, sustainability and diversity. The Directors have indicated a desire for a more formalised and regular training, a programme of which is being developed with the Company Secretary.\n\nSite visits are considered important to the Board\u2019s oversight of the Company.

Nonetheless, Erna-Maria Trixl visited one of the Company\u2019s UK onshore wind projects with the Managers and Investors once restrictions were removed. The Managers are working with the Board to select sites for annual Board visits to help build a stronger understanding of the operational environment of the Company on a day-to-day basis.\n\nAs with the previous Directors of TRIG, the current Board is diverse in its composition and thought processes. The Directors have a breadth of experience relevant to the Company. The members of the Board strive to challenge each other and the Company\u2019s Managers constructively and examine issues from multiple perspectives. The Board has a very high level of confidence in both managers. Notwithstanding this, the Board is deeply cognisant of its responsibilities to shareholders and holds the Managers to account on their progress on the execution of the Company\u2019s strategy, approach to sustainability and focus on responsible investment.\n\nDelegation of Responsibilities The Board has delegated the following areas of responsibility:\n\nThe day-to-day administration of the Company has been delegated to Aztec Financial Services (Guernsey) Limited in its capacity as Company Secretary and Administrator.\n\nA key element of the Board\u2019s role is to engage with investors, including to provide reassurance as to the robustness of their oversight of the business. During 2022, the outgoing Chairman of the Company, Helen Mahy, and incoming Chairman Richard Morse met a number of institutional shareholders and answered questions on the Company\u2019s governance. All members of the Board also had the opportunity to meet investors at the Company\u2019s Capital Markets Day in April 2022. Shareholders are also able to attend or dial into and ask questions of the Directors at the Company\u2019s Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Investment Manager has full discretion (within agreed parameters) to make investments in accordance with the Company\u2019s Investment Policy and has responsibility for financial administration and investor relations, in addition to advising the Board in relation to further capital raisings and the payment of dividends, amongst other matters, subject to the overall supervision and oversight of the Board. Among the specific tasks of the Investment Manager are the overall financial management of the Company and existing portfolio as a whole, including the deployment of capital, management of the Group\u2019s debt facilities, hedging arrangements, the sourcing of new investments, preparing the semi-annual valuations, the statutory accounts, the management accounts, business plans, presenting results and\n\n112\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\ninformation to shareholders, coordinating all corporate service providers to the Group and giving the Board general advice.\n\nThe Operations Manager is responsible for monitoring, evaluating and optimising technical and financial performance across the portfolio. The services provided by the Operations Manager include maintaining an overview of project operations and reporting on key performance measures, recommending and implementing strategy on management of the portfolio including energy sales agreements, insurance, maintenance and other areas requiring portfolio-level decisions, maintaining and monitoring health and safety and operating risk management policies. The Operations Manager also works jointly with the Investment Manager on sourcing and transacting new business, providing assistance in due diligence of potential new acquisitions, refinancing of existing assets and investor relations.

Market quotations are not available for these financial assets, and as such, their valuation is undertaken using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires a series of material judgements to be made, as further explained in Note 4 to the financial statements.\n\nThe Audit Committee considers the remaining operating life assumptions in light of public information provided by the Company\u2019s peer group and reports provided by the Operations Manager during the year, considering the remaining operational lives for investments and considering any potential extension of those lives and the recognition of additional value resulting to be appropriate. The independent valuation carried out in June 2022 also supported the assumed operating lives.\n\nThe valuation process and methodology were discussed by the Audit Committee with the Investment Manager at the time of the interim review, in November 2022 prior to the year-end valuation process and again in February 2023 as part of the year-end sign- off process. The Committee met with the auditor when it reviewed and agreed the auditor\u2019s Group audit plan and also at the conclusion of the audit of the financial statements, in particular discussing the valuation process. The Investment Manager carries out a valuation semi-annually and provides a detailed valuation report to the Company. The Company also engaged a third-party valuation expert to provide an independent valuation at June 2022 and also to review the valuation discount rates at December 2022. In July 2022 the expert provided a report to the Audit Committee that corroborated the valuation of the portfolio as at June 2022. The expert also provided a report to the Audit Committee in February 2023 confirming that the discount rates adopted at 31 December 2022 were reasonable.\n\nThe Investment Manager has discussed and agreed the valuation assumptions with the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee held discussions with the external auditor and the Investment Manager and ensured appropriate challenge was applied. In relation to the key judgements underpinning the valuation, the Investment Manager has provided sensitivities showing the impact of changing these assumptions and these have been reviewed by the Investment Manager and the Audit Committee to assist in forming an opinion on the fairness and balance of the annual report together with their conclusion on the overall valuation.\n\nValuation Discount Rates The bifurcated discount rates adopted to determine the valuation are selected and recommended by the Investment Manager. The Company uses a bifurcated discount rate approach (as more fully explained on page 56).\n\nValuation of Investments \u2013 key forecast assumptions The Audit Committee considered in detail those assumptions that are subject to judgement that have a material impact on the valuation. The key assumptions are:\n\nPower Price Assumptions A significant proportion of the wind and solar projects\u2019 income streams are contracted subsidy receipts and power income under long-term PPAs; some of which have fixed price mechanisms. However, over time the proportion of power income that is fixed reduces and the proportion where the Company has exposure to wholesale electricity prices increases. The Investment Manager considers the forecasts provided by a number of expert energy advisers and adopts a profile of assumed future power prices by jurisdiction. Further detail on the assumptions made in relation to power prices and other variables that may be expected to affect these are included in the Valuation section of the Strategic Report.\n\nMacroeconomic Assumptions Macroeconomic assumptions include inflation, foreign exchange, interest and tax rate assumptions.

The resulting valuation is sensitive to the discount rates selected. The Investment Manager is experienced and active in the area of valuing these investments and adopts discount rates reflecting its current extensive experience of the market. It is noted, however, that this requires subjective judgement and that there is a range of discount rates which could be applied. The discount rate assumptions and the sensitivity of the valuation of the investments to this discount rate are set out in the Valuation section of the Strategic Report.\n\nThe Audit Committee discussed with the Investment Manager the process adopted to arrive at the selected valuation discount rates (which includes comparison with other market transactions, information available from peer group companies and an independent review of valuation discount rates by a third-party valuation expert both at December 2021 and at December 2022) and satisfied itself that the rates applied were appropriate.\n\nAuditor Interaction The external auditor explained the results of their review of the valuation, including their consideration of the Company\u2019s underlying cash flow projections, the macro economic assumptions and discount rates to the Audit Committee. On the basis of their audit work there were no adjustments proposed that were material in the context of the financial statements as\n\n116\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\na whole.

A scoring based on 1 to 5 for Likelihood and 1 to 5 for Impact is used and these are multiplied together to give a total score. Mitigation is considered on a scale of 1 to 5 and this leads to a residual risk rating being derived. The matrix is updated on an ongoing basis and reviewed quarterly and the Board considers all material changes to the risk ratings and the action which has been, or is being, taken. By their nature, these procedures will provide a reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nThe Investment Manager prepares management accounts and updates business forecasts on a quarterly basis, which allow the Board to assess the Company\u2019s activities and review its performance. The Board and the Investment Manager have agreed clearly defined investment criteria, return targets, risk appetite and exposure limits. Reports on these performance measures, coupled with cash projections and investment valuations, are submitted to the Board at each quarterly meeting.\n\nThe Operations Manager prepares quarterly project performance and project financial analysis, and highlights the key activities performed and any specific new risks identified relating to the operating portfolio for consideration by the Board.\n\nAppointment of the external auditor Deloitte LLP was first appointed to be external auditor for the TRIG Group on 19 September 2013 and reappointed for a second time following an extensive audit tender process that concluded in December 2021.

Deloitte\u2019s reappointment was subsequently ratified by shareholders at the Company\u2019s AGM in May 2022.\n\nAt each Board meeting, the Board also monitors the Group\u2019s investment performance and it reviews the Group\u2019s activities since the last Board meeting to ensure that the Investment Manager is adhering to the Company\u2019s Investment Policy and approved investment guidelines. The pipeline of new potential opportunities is considered and the prices paid for new investments during the quarter are also reviewed.\n\nIn line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and in particular the requirement to put the external audit out to tender at least every 10 years, the Audit Committee conducted a tender exercise for the external audit of the Company during 2021, as communicated fully in the Audit Committee report 12 months ago. The tender exercise was run during the ninth year of Deloitte\u2019s appointment as the Company\u2019s auditor. The Company intends to run the next audit tender process within 10 years of the recently run process \u2013 i.e. during or before 2031.\n\nFurther, at each Board meeting, the Board receives reports from the Company Secretary and Administrator in respect of compliance matters and duties they have performed on behalf of the Company.\n\nThe Board has considered the need for an internal audit function and it has decided that the systems and procedures employed by the Investment Manager, the Operations Manager and the Administrator, including their own internal review processes and the processes in place in relation to the Company, provide sufficient assurance that a sound system of internal control, which safeguards the Company\u2019s assets, is maintained. An internal audit function specific to the Company is therefore considered unnecessary. There is no impact on the work of the external auditor as a result of not having an internal audit function.\n\nThe 2021 audit tender process took into consideration best practice in line with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the 2019 AIC Code of Corporate Governance. This ensured a fair, robust and independent tender process was conducted to ensure the Company appointed the most suitable firm.\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2021 audit tender process and following the Audit Committee review of submissions and in-person presentations from shortlisted firms, the Committee members resolved to recommend the continuing appointment of Deloitte as auditors, deeming this course of action to be in the best interests of shareholders, by virtue of the strength and experience of the Deloitte audit team and lack of demonstrable differentiation shown by challengers.\n\nThe Board recognises that these control systems can only be designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss, and relies on the operating controls established by the Company\u2019s Administrator, the Investment Manager and the Operations Manager.

In addition, Notes 1 to 4 to the financial statements include the Group\u2019s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\nThe Directors have assessed ongoing risks (such as recovery from Covid-19, rising inflation and interest rates, the Ukraine conflict, and global supply chain issues) and do not believe that there is a significant risk to the business as a result of these uncertainties and will continue to monitor any future developments.\n\nThe Company is affected by climate-related risks, as set out in the Company\u2019s TCFD reporting, and the Board consider these when they assess the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company continues to assess, monitor and where necessary and possible, mitigate and manage these risks.\n\nThe Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.\n\nThis conclusion is based on a review of the Company\u2019s cash flow projections including reasonably expected downside sensitivities together with cash and committed borrowing facilities available to it.\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n125\n\n4.7\n\nSection NumberHeading 0\n\n4.6 Report of the Directors (continued)\n\nInternal Controls Review Taking into account the information on emerging and principal risks and uncertainties provided in Section 3.4 \u2013 Risk and Risk Management and the ongoing work of the Audit Committee in monitoring the risk management and internal control systems on behalf of the Board (see Section 4.4, the Audit Committee Report), the Directors:\n\nShare Repurchases No shares have been bought back in the period. The latest authority for the Company to make market purchases of Ordinary Shares was granted to the Directors on 27 May 2022 and expires on the date of the next Annual General Meeting. The Directors are proposing that their authority to buy back shares be renewed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.\n\n\u25b2 are satisfied that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal and emerging risks facing the Company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;\n\nTreasury Shares Section 315 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 allows companies to hold shares acquired by market purchase as treasury shares, rather than having to cancel them. Up to 14.99% of the number of shares in issue at the date of the last AGM (5 May 2021) may be held in treasury and may be subsequently cancelled or sold for cash in the market. This gives the Company the ability to reissue shares quickly and cost-efficiently, thereby improving liquidity and providing the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.\n\n\u25b2 are satisfied the Company has adequate safeguards and procedures in place to function effectively and ensure operational continuity in the event of a major business interruption (such as a pandemic or cyber attack) including step-in plans for key personnel and systems;\n\n\u25b2 continue to monitor emerging risks facing the company,\n\nincluding but not limited to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, inflationary pressures and constraints in global supply chains; and\n\nThere are currently no shares held in treasury.

Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council\u2019s (the \u2018FRC\u2019s\u2019) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the company for the year are disclosed in note 7 to the financial statements. We confirm that we have not provided any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC\u2019s Ethical Standard to the company.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n3.

Conclusions relating to going concern In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors\u2019 use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nOur evaluation of the directors\u2019 assessment of the company\u2019s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n\u25b2 evaluating management\u2019s going concern paper, identifying the assumptions applied in the going concern assessment;\n\n\u25b2 assessing the reasonableness of assumptions used in the forecasts including the impact of climate change and energy market\n\ndisruption;\n\n\u25b2 evaluating consistency of the forecast assumptions applied in the going concern assessment with forecasts used within the\n\ninvestment valuation;\n\n\u25b2 testing of clerical accuracy and our assessment of the integrity of the model used to prepare the forecasts;\n\n\u25b2 assessing the historical accuracy of forecasts prepared by management;\n\n\u25b2 reviewing the revolving credit facility (RCF), as renewed and extended in January 2023, including consideration of availability and\n\ncompliance with covenants;\n\n\u25b2 assessing the future commitments and guarantees of the company; and\n\n\u25b2 considering the amount of headroom in the forecasts (cash and revolving credit facility covenants).\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn relation to the reporting on how the company has applied the Association of Investment Companies Code of Corporate Governance, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors\u2019 statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n5. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n131\n\n5.1 Independent Auditor\u2019s Report to the Members of The Renewables Infrastructure Group Limited (continued)\n\n5.1 The assessment of the fair value of investments\n\nKey audit matter description\n\nThe company\u2019s investments held at fair value at 31 December 2022, comprise of investments in intermediate holding companies and equity and subordinated debt interests as well as mezzanine level bonds in wind farm, solar park and battery storage projects. The company, its subsidiaries and its portfolio of investments are known as \u201cthe Group\u201d. These investments are classified at Level 3 within the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy and their valuation requires significant judgement.\n\nThe company\u2019s portfolio continues to grow, having increased by \u00a3685.8m in the year to \u00a33,322.6m at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: \u00a32,636.8m).

Our application of materiality 6.1. Materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\nMateriality\n\n\u00a366.0m (2021: \u00a354.0m)\n\nBasis for determining materiality\n\n2% of shareholders\u2019 equity (2021: 2% of shareholders\u2019 equity)\n\nRationale for the benchmark applied\n\nWe consider equity to be the key benchmark used by shareholders of the company in assessing finan- cial performance. The reason for the significant increase in materiality relates to the growth in this bench- mark, which has been primarily driven by increases in investments at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nShareholders\u2019 equity \u00a33,342.7m\n\nMateriality \u00a366.0m\n\nShareholders\u2019 equity\n\nMateriality\n\nAudit Committee reporting threshold \u00a33.3m\n\nA lower materiality threshold of \u00a34.2m (2021: \u00a33.1m) based upon 3% of income from investments (excluding fair value movements in the portfolio valuation) has also been used. This has been applied to balances in the income statement and balance sheet, excluding fair value of investments and derivatives balances and their associated fair value movements, due to qualitative factors of stakeholder interest.\n\n6.2. Performance materiality We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. Performance materiality was set at 70% of materiality for the 2022 audit (2021: 70%). In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors:\n\na.\n\nthe quality of the control environment; and\n\nb.\n\nthe low level of corrected and uncorrected misstatements identified in the prior period.\n\n6.3. Error reporting threshold We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of \u00a33.3m (2021: \u00a32.7m) in respect of the balances associated with the portfolio valuation, and all audit differences in excess of \u00a30.21m (2021: \u00a30.16m) for all other balances, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\n7. An overview of the scope of our audit 7.1. Scoping Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environment, including internal control, and assessing the risks of material misstatement. Audit work to respond to the risks of material misstatement was performed directly by the audit engagement team. As the company is an investment entity under IFRS 10, its subsidiaries are measured at fair value rather than consolidated on a line-by- line basis. Therefore, the company has been treated as having only one component and all of the audit work was performed directly by the audit engagement team.\n\n134\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n7.2 Our consideration of the control environment We have obtained an understanding of the control environment and the relevant controls around journal entries, the financial reporting process, the valuations process and relevant controls operating at the Investment Manager as a key service provider to the company.\n\n7.3. Our consideration of climate-related risks Management has considered transition and physical risks when factoring in climate change as part of their risk assessment process when considering the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company.

Our consideration of climate-related risks Management has considered transition and physical risks when factoring in climate change as part of their risk assessment process when considering the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company. These risks have been focused on the assumptions underlying the valuation of investments, and include power price forecasts, energy yields, asset availability and maintenance costs. In our evaluation of the climate-related risks facing the company, we considered that the key assumption is the power price forecasts; this is linked to the key audit matter as highlighted in section 5.1, where we have described both the risks related to these assumptions and our audit procedures in relation to the challenge of this assumption. The climate change risk factors underpinning the assumptions have been explained in note 3 of the financial statements. With the involvement of our ESG specialists, we have evaluated the appropriateness of disclosures included in the financial statements and have read the annual report to consider whether other climate change disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained in the audit, including the consideration of net zero power curves used to assess the impact of certain transition risks on the valuation of the portfolio.\n\n8. Other information The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor\u2019s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n9. Responsibilities of directors As explained more fully in the directors\u2019 responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n10. Auditor\u2019s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC\u2019s website at: www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor\u2019s report.\n\n11.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC\u2019s website at: www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor\u2019s report.\n\n11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. 11.1 Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n135\n\n5.1 Independent Auditor\u2019s Report to the Members of The Renewables Infrastructure Group Limited (continued)\n\n\u25b2 the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the company\u2019s\n\nremuneration policies, key drivers for directors\u2019 remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;\n\n\u25b2 results of our enquiries of management, the directors and the Audit Committee about their own identification and assessment of the\n\nrisks of irregularities, including those that are specific to the company\u2019s sector;\n\n\u25b2 any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the company\u2019s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:\n\no identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;\n\no detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;\n\no the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;\n\n\u25b2 the matters discussed among the audit engagement team and relevant internal specialists, including tax and valuations specialists\n\nregarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.\n\nAs a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the assessment of fair value of investments. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.\n\nWe also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the company operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, the Listing Rules and relevant tax legislation.\n\nIn addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the company\u2019s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the Alternative Investment Fund Managers (\u201cAIFM\u201d) Directive, Association of Investment Companies (\u201cAIC\u201d) Code of Corporate Governance, Non-Mainstream Pooled Investments (\u201cNMPI\u201d) regulations.\n\n11.2 Audit response to risks identified As a result of performing the above, we identified the assessment of the fair value of investments as a key audit matter related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matter in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to that key audit matter. In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following: \u25b2 reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of\n\nrelevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;\n\n\u25b2 enquiring of management and the Audit Committee concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;\n\n\u25b2 performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement\n\ndue to fraud;\n\n\u25b2 reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance; and\n\n\u25b2 in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.\n\nWe also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.\n\nReport on other legal and regulatory requirements 12.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17e3bde4-97be-4a13-ae5e-b032476252cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "17e3bde4-97be-4a13-ae5e-b032476252cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49f69416-8357-49ca-a1e6-2a1f9e7be413", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "6905ebc85307bbc375aa0ebd89d0e3997049b36fa2cdad7fd6ecfec60dcc1b42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b65e4d1-58e5-4575-a331-cc58a36ef019", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "e509ac2d74f874a7588e64208eccb2a7837b2795cf3d1700df35b4d636125164", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d7b135cb-348f-4951-83c2-f1615bcda6cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "74b2c7103d42ede066611da59c798f45d44331c9f6b462b9dc482ae4f472e754", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a21c93ee11044b66f1bdd4dc8d4b54964217da8e5c00e39bf9c4232487cf99f1", "text": "We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.\n\nReport on other legal and regulatory requirements 12.

These financial statements are for the year ended 31 December 2022 and comprise only the results of the Company, as all of its subsidiaries are measured at fair value as explained below in Note 2 (a).\n\n2. Key accounting policies (a) Basis of preparation The financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 21 February 2023.\n\nThe financial statements, which give a true and fair view, have been prepared in compliance with the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) as adopted by the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) using the historical cost basis, except that the financial instruments classified at fair value through profit or loss are stated at their fair values. All accounting policies have been applied consistently in these financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Company\u2019s functional currency. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in this note.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years. Note 3 shows critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions.\n\n(b) Going concern The Group\u2019s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report and also commented on in the Viability Statement on page 82. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Results on pages 67 to 73. In addition, Notes 1 to 4 of the financial statements include the Group\u2019s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\nThe Group has the necessary financial resources to meet its obligations for the foreseeable future. The Group benefits from a range of long-term contracts with various major UK and European utilities and well-established suppliers across a range of infrastructure projects.\n\nOn 3 February 2023, the revolving credit facility was renewed and extended from \u00a3600m to \u00a3750m with an expiry date of 31 December 2025. The revolving credit facility includes a working capital component of \u00a345m and is limited to 30% of Portfolio Value.\n\nThe revolving credit facility is ESG-linked, resulting in a possible increase or reduction to future interest payments based on the company\u2019s performance against KPIs relating to ESG targets over time.\n\nThe Group\u2019s project-level financing is non \u2013 recourse to the Company and is limited to 50% of Gross Portfolio Value. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Company\u2019s leverage was 11% for fund-level financing (2021: 3%) and 38% for project-level financing (2021: 40%).\n\nThe Company has sufficient headroom on its revolving credit facility covenants. These covenants have been tested and relate to interest cover ratios and group gearing limits and the Company does not expect these covenants to be breached.

These covenants have been tested and relate to interest cover ratios and group gearing limits and the Company does not expect these covenants to be breached. The Company and its direct subsidiaries have a number of guarantees, detailed in note 20 of these financial statements. These guarantees relate to certain\n\n144\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\nobligations that may become due by the underlying investments over their useful economic lives. We do not anticipate these guarantees to be called in the next 12 months and in many cases the potential obligations are insured by the underlying investments.\n\nA cash balance of \u00a324.5m at 31 December 2022 is held by the Company, with further amounts held in the Company\u2019s direct and indirect subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has a working capital facility on its revised revolving credit facility of \u00a345m, which remains undrawn at the date of signing this report.\n\nFurther to the above, the Company has a number of outstanding commitments which are detailed in Section 2.2 of this Annual Report and Note 20 of these financial statements. These commitments can be fully covered by the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility.\n\nAs a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. The directors do not believe that there is a significant risk to the business as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine but will continue to monitor any future developments.\n\nThe Company is affected by climate-related risks, as set out in the Company\u2019s TCFD reporting, and the Board consider these when they assess the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company continues to assess, monitor and where necessary and possible, mitigate and manage these risks.\n\nHaving performed the assessment of going concern, the Directors considered it appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Company on a going concern basis. The Company has sufficient financial resources and liquidity and is well placed to manage business risks in the current economic environment (including but not limited to the conflict in Ukraine and current upward inflationary pressures) and can continue operations for a period of at least 12 months from the date of these financial statements.\n\n(c) Basis of consolidation The Company applies IFRS 10 \u201cConsolidated Financial Statements\u201d, and as an investment entity is required to measure all of its subsidiaries at fair value. The financial statements therefore comprise the results of the Company only. Subsidiaries are those entities owned by the Company. The Company has ownership of an investee, when it is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee as defined in IFRS 10 \u201cConsolidated Financial Statements\u201d.\n\nThe Directors believe it is appropriate and relevant to the investor to account for the investment portfolio at fair value, where consolidating it would not be.\n\nThe Company\u2019s subsidiaries, TRIG UK and TRIG UK I, carry out investment activities and incur overheads and borrowings on behalf of the Group. The Directors therefore provide an alternative presentation of the Company\u2019s results in the Strategic Report on pages 67 to 73 prepared under the \u201cExpanded basis\u201d, which includes the consolidation of TRIG UK and TRIG UK I.\n\nAn entity shall consider all facts and circumstances when assessing whether it is an investment entity, including its purpose and design.

The Company\u2019s exit of its investments in project companies may be at the time the existing turbines or other generation assets get to the end of their economic lives or planning or leasehold land interests expire, at which point the project companies may be considering redevelopment (referred to as a \u201crepowering\u201d) of the site. The Company may remain invested in the event there is the opportunity to repower and undertake the repowering, subject to its investment limits on construction activity being met and depending on economic considerations at the time. The Company may also exit investments earlier for reasons of portfolio balance or profit, as there is an active secondary market for renewables projects in the countries in which we operate.\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n145\n\n6.2 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\nIn respect of the third criterion, the board evaluates the performance of the assets on a fair market value basis throughout the year as part of the management accounts review, and the company undertakes a fair market valuation of its portfolio twice a year for inclusion in its report and accounts with the movement in the valuation taken to the Income Statement and thus measured within its earnings.\n\nTaking these factors into consideration, the Directors are of the opinion that the Company has all the typical characteristics of an investment entity and meets the definition in the standard.\n\n(d) Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred, and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IFRS 9 \u201cFinancial Instruments\u201d.\n\nFinancial derivatives are valued using a mark to market valuation based on the underlying derivative contracts that are executed with the banks. The movements in mark to market valuation are recognised in the profit and loss statement.\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables.\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value (including directly attributable transaction costs where these instruments are held at amortised cost). Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.\n\nInvestments in equity and debt securities Investments in the equity, loan stock and mezzanine debt of entities engaged in renewable energy activities are designated upon initial recognition as held at fair value through profit or loss. Gains or losses resulting from the movement in fair value are recognised in the Income Statement at each valuation point.\n\nFinancial assets are recognised/derecognised at fair value at the date of the purchase/disposal. A financial asset (in whole or part) is derecognised either:\n\n\u25b2 when the group has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership; or\n\n\u25b2 when it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards when it no longer has control over the asset or a\n\nportion of the asset; or\n\n\u25b2 when the contractual rights to receive cash flow have expired.\n\nThe initial difference between the transaction price and the fair value, derived from using the discounted cash flows methodology at the date of acquisition, is recognised only when observable market data indicates there is a change in a factor that market participants would consider in setting the price of that investment. For the years ended 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021, there were no such differences.\n\nThe Group manages these investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value.\n\nThe Directors consider the equity and loan stock to share the same investment characteristics and risks and they are therefore treated as a single unit of account for valuation purposes and a single class for disclosure purposes.\n\n(e) Impairment Financial assets Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97ab1a09-99c9-4a82-a233-188f4feb1b3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "97ab1a09-99c9-4a82-a233-188f4feb1b3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49f69416-8357-49ca-a1e6-2a1f9e7be413", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "6905ebc85307bbc375aa0ebd89d0e3997049b36fa2cdad7fd6ecfec60dcc1b42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9328ff19-2a53-4d8b-9c1e-f581d4d2c056", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "fb17ff8c0485d474680f8e2c842e14f8e9b1601086d51826a2da50a7da55a434", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a146890e-5ed1-4350-9863-ace381b72721", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "f935db7a5c3f8e4447daf176028fd74e85c0797b91ed22f6ba3334ca0bb4e3dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8c2d2c5672fcb1f43ff49523caab6b7d77ef51283da7e056ebfa937dcf65b9d7", "text": "The initial difference between the transaction price and the fair value, derived from using the discounted cash flows methodology at the date of acquisition, is recognised only when observable market data indicates there is a change in a factor that market participants would consider in setting the price of that investment.

A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. Significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. All impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. For financial assets measured at amortised cost the reversal is recognised in the income statement. Expected credit losses are assessed and measured annually and where appropriate, recognised as a loss allowance.\n\n146\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n(f) Share capital and share premium Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or associated with the establishment of the Company that would otherwise have been avoided are written off against the value of the ordinary share premium.\n\n(g) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statement.\n\n(h) Investment income Income from investments relates solely to returns from the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, TRIG UK and TRIG UK I. This is recognised as it accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable and dividends when these are received.\n\n(i) Under the current system of taxation in Guernsey, the Company is exempt from paying taxes on non-Guernsey source income or capital gains.\n\nIncome tax\n\n(j) Foreign exchange gains and losses Transactions entered into by the Company in a currency other than its functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n(k) Segmental reporting The Chief Operating Decision Maker (the \u201cCODM\u201d) is of the opinion that the Group is engaged in a single segment of business, being investment in renewable infrastructure to generate investment returns while preserving capital. The financial information used by the CODM to allocate resources and manage the Group presents the business as a single segment comprising a homogeneous portfolio.\n\n(l) Fund expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis. The Company\u2019s investment management and administration fees (refer to Note 7), finance costs and all other expenses are charged through the income statement.\n\n(m) Acquisition costs In line with IFRS 3 (Revised), acquisition costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.\n\n(n) Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. In the case of interim dividends, this is when they are paid.

Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below. Key source of estimation uncertainty: Investments at fair value through profit or loss IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Board base the fair value of the investments on information received from the Investment Manager. Fair value is calculated on a discounted cash flow basis.\n\nFair values for those investments for which a market quote is not available, in this instance being all investments, are determined using the income approach, which discounts the expected cash flows at the appropriate rate. In determining the discount rate, relevant long-term government bond yields, specific risks associated with the technology (onshore wind, offshore wind, battery storage and solar) and geographic location of the underlying investment, and the evidence of recent transactions have all been considered. The investments at fair value through profit or loss, whose fair values include the use of level 3 inputs, are valued by discounting future cash flows from investments in both equity (dividends and equity redemptions) and subordinated loans (interest and repayments) to the Group at an appropriate discount rate.\n\nThe weighted average discount rate applied in the December 2022 valuation was 7.2% (2021: 6.6%). The discount rate is considered one of the most significant unobservable inputs through which an increase or decrease would have a material impact on the fair value of the investments at fair value through profit or loss, which are further discussed in Note 4 under sensitivities.\n\nThe other material impacts on the measurement of fair value are the forward-looking power price curve, energy yields, operating costs and macro economic assumptions (including rates of inflation) which are further discussed in Note 4 under sensitivities. The company considers climate-related risks such as power prices (including the impact of net zero curves), asset availability and maintenance costs when assessing these assumptions. Further information on these climate change risks is discussed in more detail in part 4 of Section 3.6 in of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Investment Manager, when considering the assumptions to apply to the valuation of the investments at 31 December 2022, considers several key assumptions.\n\nKey judgements By virtue of the Company\u2019s status as an investment fund, and in conjunction with IFRS 10 for investment entities, investments are designated upon initial recognition to be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe Directors consider that the carrying value amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statement are approximately equal to their fair values.\n\n4.

Financial instruments Financial risk management The objective of the Group\u2019s financial risk management is to manage and control the risk exposures of its investment portfolio. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for overseeing the management of financial risks, however the review and management of financial risks are delegated to the Investment Manager, which has documented procedures designed to identify, monitor and manage the financial risks to which the Group is exposed. Note 4 presents information about the Group\u2019s exposure to financial risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing risk and the Group\u2019s management of its financial resources. Through its subsidiaries, TRIG UK and TRIG UK I, the Company invests in a portfolio of investments predominantly in the subordinated loan stock and ordinary equity of renewable energy project companies. These companies are structured at the outset to minimise financial risks where possible, and the Investment Manager primarily focuses their risk management on the direct financial risks of\n\n148\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\nacquiring and holding the portfolio but continues to monitor the indirect financial risks of the underlying projects through representation, where appropriate, on the Boards of the project companies, and the receipt of regular financial and operational performance reports.\n\nThe Company has a diversified portfolio of assets which include investments with both higher and lower risks and returns. These risks and return differences relate, but are not limited to, qualification to receive government subsidies, exposure to fluctuations in future energy prices and levels of project finance debt.\n\nInterest rate risk The Group invests in subordinated loan stock of project companies, usually with fixed interest rate coupons. The portfolio\u2019s cash flows are continually monitored and reforecast, both over the near future and the long-term, to analyse the cash flow returns from investments. The Group may use borrowings to finance the acquisition of investments and the forecasts are used to monitor the impact of changes in borrowing rates against cash flow returns from investments as increases in borrowing rates will reduce net interest margins.\n\nThe Group\u2019s policy is to ensure that interest rates are sufficiently hedged to protect the Group\u2019s net interest margins from significant fluctuations when entering into material medium-long-term borrowings. This includes engaging in interest rate swaps or other interest rate derivative contracts.\n\nThe Company has an indirect exposure to changes in interest rates through its investment in project companies, many of which are financed by senior debt. Senior debt financing of project companies is generally either through floating rate debt, fixed rate bonds or index-linked bonds. Where senior debt is floating rate, the projects typically have similar length hedging arrangements in place, which are monitored by the project companies\u2019 managers, finance parties and boards of directors.\n\nThe revolving credit facility is ESG-linked, resulting in a possible increase or reduction to future interest payments based on the Group\u2019s performance against KPIs relating to ESG targets over time. More details can be found in part 11 of Section 3.6 of this annual report.\n\nInflation risk The Group\u2019s project companies are generally structured so that contractual income and costs are either wholly or partially linked to specific inflation, where possible, to minimise the risks of mismatch between income and costs due to movements in inflation indexes. The Group\u2019s overall cash flows vary with inflation, although they are not directly correlated as not all flows are indexed. The effects of these inflation changes do not always immediately flow through to the Group\u2019s cash flows, particularly where a project\u2019s loan stock debt carries a fixed coupon and the inflation changes flow through by way of changes to dividends in future years. Inflation is managed through the use of inflation-linked swaps where the Group deems it to be appropriate. The sensitivity of the portfolio valuation is shown further on in Note 4.\n\nMarket risk Returns from the Group\u2019s investments are affected by the price at which the investments are acquired. The value of these investments will be a function of the discounted value of their expected future cash flows, and as such will vary with, inter alia, movements in interest rates, market prices and the competition for such assets. The Investment Manager carries out a full valuation semi-annually and this valuation exercise considers changes described above.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ac19a57-82e9-4f5d-8055-782e13106b24": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ac19a57-82e9-4f5d-8055-782e13106b24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49f69416-8357-49ca-a1e6-2a1f9e7be413", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "6905ebc85307bbc375aa0ebd89d0e3997049b36fa2cdad7fd6ecfec60dcc1b42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "32fb2500-4a2b-435f-8e57-2f6bbf3ca7aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "94925bc99a9b5768800ce3a353c9abecd9c67a606ad94673d4472866a19d32a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2f3ce527-2998-4678-88df-0179ca7320bd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\Catalect\\Documents\\GitHub\\fin-doc-chat\\data\\TRIG10.pdf", "file_name": "TRIG10.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 6689743, "creation_date": "2023-11-08", "last_modified_date": "2023-11-08", "last_accessed_date": "2023-11-22"}, "hash": "2006d6bb42592b505c22b0da2a134a293f01baf7af5fa0c4b8715c175f53b126", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "17151e21b7871104ee9f8bfb0e54145d2622b7b0a2887c53362654b10c0b42cb", "text": "The Group\u2019s overall cash flows vary with inflation, although they are not directly correlated as not all flows are indexed.

The sensitivity of the portfolio valuation is shown in this note.\n\nThe Group monitors its foreign exchange exposures using its near-term and long-term cash flow forecasts. Its policy is to use foreign exchange hedging to provide protection to the level of sterling distributions that the Company aims to pay over the medium term, where considered appropriate. This may involve the use of forward exchange.\n\nCredit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty of the Group will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group. Key credit ratings for the Company\u2019s counterparties are detailed in Note 18.\n\nThe credit standing of subcontractors is reviewed, and the risk of default estimated for each significant counterparty position. Monitoring is ongoing, and year-end positions are reported to the Board on a quarterly basis. The Group\u2019s largest credit risk exposure to a project\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n149\n\n6.2 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\nat 31 December 2022 was to the Hornsea One project, representing 9% (2021: Beatrice project, representing 10%) of the invested portfolio value.\n\nThe largest subcontractor counterparty risk exposure (O&M or OEM whereby the maintenance provider is not always the original equipment manufacturer) was to Vestas who provided turbine maintenance services in respect of 21% (2021: Vestas 24%) of the invested portfolio by value. The largest exposure to any equipment manufacturer was to Siemens who provided turbines in respect of 46% of the invested portfolio value (2021: Siemens 46%).\n\nThe Group\u2019s investments enter into Power Price Agreements (\u201cPPA\u201d) with a range of providers through which electricity is sold; the PPAs are priced into the fair value of the investments. The largest PPA provider to the portfolio at 31 December 2022 was Statkraft, who provided PPAs to projects in respect of 17% (2021: Statkraft 19%) of the invested portfolio value.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, there were no loans and other receivables considered impaired for the Group.\n\nThe Group\u2019s maximum exposure to credit risk over financial assets is the carrying value of those assets in the balance sheet. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.\n\nLiquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group\u2019s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to meet its liabilities when due. The Group ensures it maintains adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

or in the process of being enacted within each of the jurisdictions in which the Group has invested, which would impact generating assets under specific conditions in relation to the revenue received from the sale of electricity at elevated prices.\n\nWithin the UK the Electricity Generator Levy (\u201cEGL\u201d) (published as draft legislation in December) is expected to be incorporated within the Spring Finance Bill 2023. It will have effect from 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2028 and applies a levy of 45% (which is not deductible for corporation tax, resulting in an effective tax rate (when considering levy and tax) of 70%) to revenues received for the sale of wholesale above a threshold level. The threshold level for revenues is \u00a375 per MWh (indexed by the Consumer Prices Index on 1 April each year from 2024) +\u00a310m per annum per group allowance (with the UK assets the Group holds considered one group). The EGL has been reflected within the valuation and the valuation sensitivities for the legislated period (beyond which the prices assumed would be below the threshold level).\n\nThe European Union had introduced a legislative framework to apply Inframarginal Caps, under which each of the national governments can introduce legislation within specified parameters. This would seek to apply a tax in respect of revenues received in excess of a threshold price (typically the applicable tax rate is between 90% to 100%). The threshold price is determined by the national governments and can vary by technology. In general, the legislation as enacted or planned to be enacted is for a relatively limited duration with an expectation that this would be extended as required \u2013 as such the valuation and sensitivities assume that the legislation will apply until the prices drop below the applicable threshold level, with the threshold level expected to remain constant in real terms.\n\nWithin Iberia, specific legislation applies (which would have a more significant impact than the inframarginal cap) to both cap the price of gas used for electricity generation and to clawback prices received by generators over a level based upon an assumed gas price where they do not incur the cost of purchasing gas. The valuation and sensitivities assume these pieces of legislation will be extended until the prices fall below the threshold level, with the threshold level expected to remain constant in real terms.\n\nA summary of the intervention measures is included within the table below:\n\nTax Measure\n\nMarket\n\nApplies above\n\nEffective rate applicable\n\nReliefs Legislated period\n\nElectricity Generator Levy\n\nUK\n\n\u00a375/MWh indexed by CPI\n\n70% (45% levy + 25% corporate tax)\n\nFirst \u00a310m p.a.\n\nper group\n\n1 Jan 2023 to 31 Mar 2028\n\nIreland\n\nEUR 120/MWh\n\n100%\n\nNone stated\n\n1 Jan 2023 to 30 Jun 2023\n\nInframarginal Revenue Cap\n\nFrance\n\nEUR 100/MWh\n\n90%\n\nExcludes FiT\u2019s and CfD\u2019s\n\n1 Jul 2022 to 31 Dec 2023\n\nGermany\n\nFeed in Tariff\n\n+ EUR 30/MWh\n\n90%\n\nAllowance for PPA costs\n\n1 Dec 2022 to 30 Jun 2023\n\nSweden\n\nEUR 180/MWh\n\n90%\n\nNone stated\n\n1 Jan 2023 to 30 Jun 2023\n\nGas Clawback\n\nSpain and Portugal\n\nA calculated level based on assumed gas price\n\n85%\n\nFormula includes an allowance to reflect some costs\n\nEnacted in 2021, applicable to 31 Dec 2023\n\nValuation sensitivities Sensitivity analysis is produced to show the impact of changes in key assumptions adopted to arrive at the valuation.

The P50 output is the estimated annual amount of electricity generation (in MWh) that has a 50% probability of being exceeded \u2013 both in any single year and over the long term \u2013 and a 50% probability of being underachieved. Hence the P50 is the expected level of generation over the long term.\n\nThe sensitivity illustrates the effect of assuming \u201cP90 10-year\u201d (a downside case) and \u201cP10 10-year\u201d (an upside case) energy production scenarios. A P90 10-year downside case assumes the average annual level of electricity generation that has a 90% probability of being exceeded over a 10-year period. A P10 10-year upside case assumes the average annual level of electricity generation that has a 10% probability of being exceeded over a 10-year period. This means that the portfolio aggregate production outcome for any given 10-year period would be expected to fall somewhere between these P90 and P10 levels with an 80% confidence level, with a 10% probability of it falling below that range of outcomes and a 10% probability of it exceeding that range.

The incremental acquisition brings the total stake to 10.2% and was completed on 27 October 2022.\n\nAlso, in March 2022, the Company acquired a 49% equity interest in Project Valdesolar, an operating solar park in the province of Badajoz, Spain from Repsol, a Spanish-listed global energy company. Together with the Cadiz solar projects, this acquisition further enhances TRIG\u2019s technological and geographical diversification.\n\nOn 8 September 2022, the Company exchanged contracts to acquire the rights to develop three battery storage sites (Ryton, Drakelow and Draw) in the North of England. Two of the projects (Ryton and Drakelow), when built are scheduled for grid connection and commencement of operations in 2024 and 2025. The third site (Drax) will be built later in line with its grid connection date, which is in 2029, although it may be possible to bring this date forward. The transaction subsequently completed on 9 September 2022 and is in line with TRIG\u2019s strategy to complement the renewable generation assets in the portfolio with flexible capacity.\n\nOn 19 December 2022, the Company exchanged contracts to acquire a further 11.1% equity interest in the Merkur offshore wind farm, located in the German North Sea. This incremental investment is approximately 2% of TRIG\u2019s portfolio value. The project completed shortly before year end and brings TRIG\u2019s total equity interest in Merkur to 35.7%.\n\nDuring December 2022, the Company also acquired 100% equity interest in Project Spennymoor, a battery storage development project which will have a total capacity of 100MW / 200MWh when completed, from RES. The project is located in County Durham, and is in the late-stage development stage.\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n165\n\n6.2 Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\nIn the year, TRIG made additional investments in the Cadiz solar projects and Gr\u00f6nhult, Ranasj\u00f6 and Salsj\u00f6 wind farms to fund their respective construction programmes, in line with outstanding commitments.\n\nFurther detail of acquisitions made in the year can be found in Section 2.5 of the Strategic Report.\n\n14.

During the year, the Board received fees for their services. Further details are provided in the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Report on page 121. Total fees for the Directors for the year were \u00a3361,044 (2021: \u00a3338,500). Directors\u2019 expenses of \u00a311,477 (2021: \u00a33,510) were also paid in the year. There are no other Key Management personnel within the Company.\n\nAll of the above transactions were undertaken on an arm\u2019s length basis.\n\n20. Guarantees and other commitments As at 31 December 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries had provided \u00a3164.0m (2021: \u00a3177.0m) in guarantees in relation to projects in the TRIG portfolio.\n\nThe Company also guarantees the revolving credit facility, entered into by TRIG UK and TRIG UK I, which it may use to acquire further investments.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022 the Company has \u00a3204.5m of future investment obligations (2021: \u00a3231.2m).\n\nMore details on timing and amounts can be found in Section 2.2 of the Strategic Report.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries have issued decommissioning and other similar guarantee bonds with a total value of \u00a344.4m (2021: \u00a322.8m).\n\n21. Contingent consideration The Group has performance-related contingent consideration obligations of up to \u00a30.4m (2021: \u00a31.8m) relating to acquisitions completed prior to 31 December 2022. These payments depend on the performance of certain wind farms and other contracted enhancements. The valuation of the investments in the portfolio does not assume that these enhancements are achieved. If further payments do become due, they would be expected to be offset by an improvement in investment. The arrangements are generally two-way in that if performance is below base case levels some refund of consideration may become due.\n\n22. Events after the balance sheet date On 2 February 2023, the Company declared an interim dividend of 1.71 pence per share for the period 1 October 2022 to 31 December 2022.

On 3 February 2023, the Company renewed and increased its revolving credit facility from \u00a3600m to \u00a3750m with a \u00a345m working capital element.\n\n23.

Performance Measures (\u201cAPMs\u201d)\n\nWe assess our performance using a variety of measures that are not specifically defined under IFRS. These alternative performance measures are termed \u201cAPMs\u201d. The APMs that we use may not be directly comparable with those used by other companies.\n\nThese APMs are used to present an alternative view of how the Company has performed over the year and are all financial measures of historical performance.\n\nThe table below defines our APMs and how they relate to the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, The Renewables Infrastructure Group UK Limited (\u201cTRIG UK\u201d) and The Renewables Infrastructure Group UK Investments Limited (\u201cTRIG UK I\u201d).\n\nPerformance Measure\n\nDefinition\n\nInvestments made\n\nThis is a measure of amounts invested into the portfolio of investments less any amounts relating to refinance proceeds or sell-downs.\n\nThe IFRS measure of investments made consists of funding into TRIG UK and TRIG UK I, which is shown in more detail in Note 13 of these financial statements.\n\nTRIG invests in its portfolio through its subsidiaries, TRIG UK and TRIG UK I. This is a measure of the valuation of the portfolio of investments only. It is exclusive of cash, working capital and debt balances in TRIG UK and TRIG UK I.\n\nDirectors\u2019 Portfolio Valuation\n\nTRIG invests in its portfolio through its subsidiaries, TRIG UK and TRIG UK I. This is a measure of the valuation of the portfolio of investments only. It is exclusive of cash, working capital and debt balances in TRIG UK and TRIG UK I.\n\nThe IFRS measure of investments at fair value through profit or loss is the Directors\u2019 Portfolio Value plus the fair value of net assets including cash, working capital and debt held in TRIG UK and TRIG UK I.\n\nDirectors\u2019 Portfolio Value (or Portfolio Value) is reconciled to investments at fair value through profit or loss in Note 13 of these financial statements.\n\nNAV per share\n\nThis is a measure of Net Asset Value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per ordinary share in the Company and is calculated as the

December 2022 (134.6p).\n\nDividend Cover\n\nDividend Cover is calculated as Cashflow from Operations (which is an Expanded Basis measure explained in section 3.2 and reconciled to the IFRS measure) divided by Dividends paid in the year.\n\nDividend Cover, when expressed on a cash basis, has cash dividends paid as the denominator and is calculated as 1.55 times for 2022.\n\nDividend Cover, when expressed as being without the benefit of scrip dividends, has the scrip dividends allocated to shareholders in lieu of cash dividends added to the cash dividends paid for the calculation. This slightly increases the denominator and hence this measure has a slightly smaller value, which was 1.5 times for 2022.\n\nSustainability Terminology Glossary\n\nTerm\n\nDefinition\n\nRenewable electricity generated\n\nThe amount of renewable electricity generated by the portfolio during the year, net of the Company\u2019s ownership share.\n\nTonnes of CO2 avoided per annum\n\nThe estimate of the portfolio\u2019s annual CO2 emission reductions, based on the portfolio\u2019s estimated generation as at the relevant reporting date prepared on the International Financial Institution\u2019s (\u201cIFI\u201d) approach to greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) Accounting.\n\nLost Time Accident Frequency Rate (LTAFR)\n\nA safety at work metric for every 100,000 hours worked. Calculated as the number of accidents which occurred in the given period divided by number of hours worked times 100,000.\n\nWhilst all accidents are recorded, only accidents that have resulted in the worker being unable to perform their normal duties for more than seven days are included in this calculation, in line with reportable accidents as defined by UK HSE RIDDOR.\n\nUK HSE RIDDOR is defined as the UK Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulation.\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n175\n\nSFDR Periodic Disclosures\n\nPursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (the \u201cSFDR\u201d), the Company has set out below the periodic disclosures based on the criteria and definitions set out in the SFDR relating to sustainability risks in respect of the Company.\n\nANNEX\n\nProduct name: The Renewables Infrastructure Group Limited Legal entity identifier: 213800NO6Q7Q7HMOMT20\n\nSustainable investment means an investment in an economic activity that contributes to an environmental or social objective, provided that the investment does not significantly harm any environmental or social objective and that the investee companies follow good governance practices.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy is a classification system laid down in Regulation (EU) 2020/852, establishing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities.

The Company\u2019s E/S Characteristics were met by focusing on the following sustainability themes:\n\n(cid:1) Mitigating climate change\n\nBy owning and operating renewable energy assets, TRIG helps to provide clean energy across the UK and Europe. Providing investment funding for new greenfield infrastructure and acquiring operational assets allows developers to recycle capital into the build-out of more renewables assets. This recycling of capital contributes to a reduction in the cost of deploying renewables. TRIG\u2019s current operational portfolio is\n\n176\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n(cid:1)\n\n(cid:1)\n\ncapable of powering the equivalent of 1.8m homes with clean energy1.\n\nIn addition, climate change measures are integrated into TRIG\u2019s policies and planning. This includes the assessment and reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities associated with our portfolio, as well as taking steps to reduce our carbon footprint. TRIG\u2019s operational portfolio contributes towards a net-zero carbon future and is currently capable of offsetting more than 2.2m tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, generating 5,376GWh of renewable electricity during 20222.\n\nDue to the nature of TRIG\u2019s investment proposition this means that, primarily, the Company\u2019s portfolio contributed towards United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy, and SDG 13 Climate action.\n\n(cid:1) Preserving the natural environment\n\nTRIG\u2019s Investment Manager, InfraRed Capital Partners (the \u201cInvestment Manager\u201d or \u201cInfraRed\u201d) and Renewable Energy Systems (the \u201c\u201cOperations Manager\u201d or \u201cRES\u201d) worked with the Company\u2019s individual project asset managers to preserve the natural environment. This includes execution of environmental management projects agreed with the authorities during the project consenting process, undertaking vegetation surveys, preventing biodiversity loss, reducing waste and recycling where possible and careful usage of materials.\n\nSpecifically, during the period, RES conducted a trial of sustainability-focused workshops to identify further enhancement and mitigation strategies for the solar and wind assets in the UK and Ireland. These workshop have resulted in the production of specialised biodiversity enhancement plans. Further information can be found in the case study set out on page 41.\n\n(cid:1) Positively impacting the communities in which the Company works\n\nWith renewable energy assets often located in rural areas where communities may experience limited employment options and limited social or health facilities, TRIG is sensitive to the impact that a project can have on its local community. Through local initiatives and direct engagement with communities, tangible benefits can be created.

In respect of this reporting period, the value of investments in \u201cother\u201d was 0.\n\nWhat actions have been taken to meet the environmental and/or social characteristics during the reference period?\n\nThe Company took several actions during the period to meet its E/S Characteristics, as outlined below.\n\n(cid:1) Mitigating Climate Change\n\nThe Company made 7 new investments during the period, renewable energy generated in the period increased from 4,125GWh to 5,376GWh. The corresponding benefits in respect of carbon emissions avoided and homes powered is reported in the table above and set out on page 39 of the Annual Report.\n\nIn addition to investing in renewable and flexibility capacity infrastructure, the Company also took a number of steps to reduce the GHG emission impacts of its portfolio. This includes increasing the proportion of the UK portfolio sourcing on-site electricity under Renewable Electricity Supply Contracts from 72% to 75% respectively. As outlined on page 40 of the Annual Report, the Company is currently developing net zero targets which will be submitted and validated with the SBTi during 2023.\n\n(cid:1) Preserving the natural environment\n\nDuring the period, the Company increased the number of environmental management projects from 14 to 20. This was due to a combination of the acquisition of additional construction projects during the period, which had environmental management plans in place, as well as initiatives which were implemented as a result of the sustainability-focused workshops completed by RES (refer to the Case Study on page 41 of the Annual Report).\n\nThe nature of the environmental projects vary between projects, but include activities such as forestry management, installing beehives on site, planting wild flowers and creating insect environments to provide food sources for hen harriers.\n\n(cid:1) Positively impacting the communities in which the Company works\n\nAs highlighted above, during 2022 TRIG distributed \u00a31.23m of community funding across 38 community funds. In addition to community funding, TRIG also looks to identify opportunities to engage with schools in the local communities to educate students on renewable energy and facilitate site visits to the projects where possible.\n\n(cid:1)\n\n182\n\nTRIG Annual Report & Financial Statements 2022\n\n(cid:1)\n\nFurther information about specific case studies for TRIG\u2019s and the Manager\u2019s community-related initiatives are provided on page 42 of this Annual Report.\n\n(cid:1) Maintaining Ethics and Integrity in Governance\n\nDuring the period several initiatives were taken to support this E/S Characteristic, including:\n\n(cid:1)(cid:1) The Investment Manager continued to undertake detailed due diligence on\n\nits supply chain, particularly in relation to new flexible capacity investments.\n\n(cid:1)(cid:1) The Operations Manager increased engagement with the portfolio\n\ncompanies to improve participation in the annual ESG survey.
